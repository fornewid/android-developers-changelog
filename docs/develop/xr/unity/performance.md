Performance is fundamental to the success of your Unity app on Android XR. While poor performance in games and apps on non-XR devices can disrupt and frustrate users, poor performance on XR devices can cause more serious problems. For example, if your frame rate spikes or drops in an XR app, it might cause a user to experience motion sickness or headaches.

This guide provides an overview of various ways that you can control and improve the performance of your Unity app for Android XR. See the following guidance to learn more:

- [Plan a GPU frame budget](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/gpu-frame-budget)
- [Adjust OpenXR Feature settings for optimal performance](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/openxr-feature-settings)
- [Improve frame rates, reduce GPU load, and reduce rendering latency using Android XR Extensions settings](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/androidxr-extension-settings)
- [Optimize GPU rendering](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/gpu-rendering)
- [Optimize performance using Unity tools and APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/unity-tools)
- [Improve audio performance](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/audio)
