### Build immersive experiences

Build fully-immersive experiences that transport the user to a fully-virtual space, enabling goals from focused productivity to boundless entertainment, or build semi-immersive experiences that blend digital content with the user's environment to unlock real-world multitasking.

### [Build spatial UI](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/ui-compose)

Build UI that's free from the limits of a device screen. Bring your app's UI into the boundless, 3D area of Full Space, or enable multitasking across multiple app windows in Home Space. For your app in Full Space, you can add 3D content, build 3D layouts, and add depth to otherwise 2D content. Do it all with a familiar, declarative toolkit using Jetpack Compose for XR.

### [Add spatial environments and spatial entitites](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/add-environments)

Customize the background of the virtual scene with spatial environments that immerse the user in a fully-digital space. Use spatial entities such as 3D models and stereoscopic video to add depth and volume, creating a transformative and engaging experience.

### [Build fully-immersive apps and games](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/transition-home-space-to-full-space)

Use the entirety of the virtual space to build apps and games that feel special in XR. Build all-encompassing experiences tailored for Full Space, or build an app that can transition from Home Space to Full Space when the moment is right. Use familiar tools and technologies.

## Supported tools and technologies

Create apps for the next generation of computing using familiar Android development tools, popular game engines ([Unity](https://unity.com/),[Godot](https://godotengine.org/), and[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)), the open standards of[OpenXR](https://openxr.org/), or the widely-accessible[WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/).  

### [Jetpack XR SDK](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk)

Most Android apps are compatible with Android XR without any additional development effort. Create differentiated app experiences with Jetpack Compose for XR, Android Studio, the emulator, and your preferred 3D tools.

### [Unity](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity)

Get full access to Unity's content production features, and easily bring apps from other platforms to Android XR. Ensure smooth development with performance optimization tools, a large asset store, and a strong community.  
[Develop with Unity](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity)  

### [OpenXR](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/openxr)

Streamline development with OpenXR's royalty-free open standard. Build anywhere using a common set of APIs to develop XR apps that work across a range of devices.  
[Develop with OpenXR](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/openxr)  

### [Godot](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/godot)

Create lightweight, open-source XR applications. Godot supports Android XR out of the box with the OpenXR Vendors plugin.  
[Develop with Godot](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/godot)  

### [Unreal Engine](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unreal)

Build immersive experiences using the high-fidelity Unreal Engine. Leverage existing OpenXR support and the native VR Template to get started immediately.  
[Develop with Unreal Engine](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unreal)  

### [WebXR](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/web)

Use the power of web technologies to build XR experiences directly in a browser. WebXR makes extended reality available to anyone with a device and a supported web browser.
