## Determine where to file your issue

To get the fastest resolution, file your issue with the team best equipped to
handle it. Review the following list to determine the appropriate support
channel:

- **Game engine and tooling issues** : If you encounter bugs with a game engine editor, standard OpenXR features, or engine-specific tools, please report them to the engine provider ([Unity](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/support#unity), [Godot Foundation](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/support#godot), or [Epic Games](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/support#unreal)).
- **Android XR platform and OS issues** : If you encounter bugs specific to the Android XR operating system, system behavior, or device compatibility (that **do not** reproduce on other OpenXR devices), please report them to Google using the channels described on this page in the [report issues](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/support#report-issues) section.

## Include detailed information in bug reports

When reporting bugs, make sure you include the following information in your bug
description:

- A clear and concise description of what the bug is
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
- A clear and concise description of what you observed
- [Capture](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report) a bug report and share the Google Drive link. If the bug report contains sensitive information, then make it private and only give access to requests from @google.com accounts.
