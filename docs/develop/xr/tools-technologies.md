When building an app for Android XR, you can choose from the following
development platforms and technologies:

### Jetpack XR SDK

The Jetpack XR SDK contains Android XR [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) libraries built
to take advantage of the unique capabilities of XR devices within the familiar
development environment of Android Studio. Start with this SDK if you want to do
any of the following:

- Optimize or enhance an existing Android mobile or tablet app for XR headsets and wired XR glasses
- Build a new Android XR app with immersive, spatialized elements for XR headsets and wired XR glasses
- Build new augmented experiences that extend your phone app to AI glasses

If you're already comfortable developing with Android Jetpack, the Jetpack XR
SDK is a natural fit for you. It's designed to seamlessly integrate with those
frameworks and libraries, and lets you use existing knowledge for building
both immersive and augmented experiences.

### Unity

[Unity Engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) is a real-time 3D development engine that lets
artists, designers, and developers collaborate to create immersive and
interactive experiences. Unity's Android XR support gives you a high level of
control over the 3D experiences you develop, while benefiting from Unity's
established OpenXR support and developer ecosystem.

If you already have an XR experience built with Unity or if you are familiar
with Unity development, then start with this option.

### OpenXR

[OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) is a royalty-free, open standard that can be used for
building high-performance, multi-platform XR experiences. Android XR supports
OpenXR 1.0 and 1.1, and we are expanding the specification with [new
extensions](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/openxr/extensions) for Android XR. Because Android XR is built on open standards,
development tools that support OpenXR and Android should be compatible with
Android XR.

### Godot

Godot supports Android XR through its OpenXR integration. You can build and
export XR applications for Android using the standard Godot workflow.

### Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine supports Android XR through the OpenXR standard. Android XR
supports apps built with OpenXR through its support for the OpenXR 1.1
specification and select vendor extensions, so you can use the standard tools
and workflows you are already familiar with in Unreal Engine 5.

### WebXR

WebXR lets you build immersive experiences for the web. It provides access to VR
and AR devices in compatible web browsers such as Chrome on Android XR.

Start with this option if you want to build an XR experience for the web or if
you want to add XR capabilities to a web app. Existing WebXR experiences will
also work on Android XR.
