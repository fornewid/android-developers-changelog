### Android XR experiments

Explore demos and experiments that show the features and capabilities of Android XR.[](https://github.com/android/xr-unity-samples/tree/main/AndroidXRUnitySamples)  

### [Unity Showcase for Android XR](https://github.com/android/xr-unity-samples/tree/main/AndroidXRUnitySamples)

These simple, yet playful, samples demonstrate Android XR immersive platform features and show how to implement the experiences. This project uses both the[Android XR: OpenXR package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.androidxr-openxr@latest)and the[Android XR Extensions for Unity package](https://github.com/android/android-xr-unity-package).

### [XR Blocks framework and demos for WebXR](https://xrblocks.github.io)

XR Blocks is an open source framework to help you develop immersive experiences for the web. It includes demos and experiments like[XR Realism](https://xrblocks.github.io/docs/samples/Occlusion)(depth-aware physics, geometry-aware occlusion, and lighting estimation),[XR Interaction](https://xrblocks.github.io/docs/samples/XR-Emoji)(hand interaction, gesture recognition), and creative[AI + XR use cases](https://xrblocks.github.io/docs/samples/XR-Poet)(Gemini, Gemini Live, LiteRT, TensorFlow Lite).
