Your app can connect with the outside world using a variety of different
communication technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB. The guides
listed below cover adding support for these technologies and for optimizing
your app for connectivity.

## Supported technologies

Android supports the following protocols and frameworks for connecting your
device to the outside world.
