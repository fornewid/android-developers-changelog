Modifiers allow you to decorate or augment a composable. Modifiers let you do
these sorts of things:

- Change the composable's size, layout, behavior, and appearance
- Add information, like accessibility labels
- Process user input
- Add high-level interactions, like making an element clickable, scrollable, draggable, or zoomable

Modifiers are standard Kotlin objects. Create a modifier by calling one of the
[`Modifier`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier) class functions:


```kotlin
@Composable
private fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(24.dp)) {
        Text(text = "Hello,")
        Text(text = name)
    }
}
```

<br />

![Two lines of text on a colored background, with padding around the text.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/modifier-1-modifier.png)

You can chain these functions together to compose them:


```kotlin
@Composable
private fun Greeting(name: String) {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .padding(24.dp)
            .fillMaxWidth()
    ) {
        Text(text = "Hello,")
        Text(text = name)
    }
}
```

<br />

![The colored background behind the text now extends the full width of the device.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/modifier-chained.png)

In the code above, notice different modifier functions used together.

- `padding` puts space around an element.
- `fillMaxWidth` makes the composable fill the maximum width given to it from its parent.

It's a best practice to have *all* of your composables accept a `modifier`
parameter, and pass that modifier to its first child that emits UI.
Doing so makes your
code more reusable and makes its behavior more predictable and intuitive. For
more information, see the Compose API guidelines, [Elements accept and respect a
Modifier parameter](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/compose/docs/compose-api-guidelines.md#elements-accept-and-respect-a-modifier-parameter).

## Order of modifiers matters

The order of modifier functions is **significant** . Since each function makes
changes to the `Modifier`returned by the previous function, the sequence
affects the final result. Let's see an example of this:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    val padding = 16.dp
    Column(
        Modifier
            .clickable(onClick = onClick)
            .padding(padding)
            .fillMaxWidth()
    ) {
        // rest of the implementation
    }
}
```

<br />

![The entire area, including the padding around the edges, responds to clicks](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-padding-clickable.gif)

In the code above the whole area is clickable, including the surrounding
padding, because the `padding` modifier has been applied *after* the `clickable`
modifier. If the modifiers order is reversed, the space added by `padding` does
not react to user input:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    val padding = 16.dp
    Column(
        Modifier
            .padding(padding)
            .clickable(onClick = onClick)
            .fillMaxWidth()
    ) {
        // rest of the implementation
    }
}
```

<br />

![The padding around the edge of the layout no longer responds to clicks](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-padding-not-clickable.gif)

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The explicit order helps you to reason about how different modifiers will interact. Compare this to the view-based system where you had to learn the box model, that margins applied "outside" the element but padding "inside" it, and a background element would be sized accordingly. The modifier design makes this kind of behavior explicit and predictable, and gives you more control to achieve the exact behavior you want. It also explains why there is not a margin modifier but only a `padding` one.

## Built-in modifiers

Jetpack Compose provides a list of built-in modifiers to help you decorate or
augment a composable. Here are some common modifiers you'll use to adjust your
layouts.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Many of these modifiers are designed to help you arrange your UI's layout just the way you need it. For more information about how modifiers work in your layout, see the [Compose layout basics](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/basics) documentation.

### `padding` and `size`

By default, layouts provided in Compose wrap their children. However,
you can set a size by using the [`size`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).size(androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp)) modifier:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.size(width = 400.dp, height = 100.dp)
    ) {
        Image(/*...*/)
        Column { /*...*/ }
    }
}
```

<br />

Note that the size you specified might not be respected if it does not satisfy
the constraints coming from the layout's parent. If you require the composable
size to be fixed regardless of the incoming constraints, use the `requiredSize`
modifier:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.size(width = 400.dp, height = 100.dp)
    ) {
        Image(
            /*...*/
            modifier = Modifier.requiredSize(150.dp)
        )
        Column { /*...*/ }
    }
}
```

<br />

![Child image is bigger than the constraints coming from its parent](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-requiredsize-new.png)

In this example, even with the parent `height` set to `100.dp`, the height of
the `Image` will be `150.dp`, as the `requiredSize` modifier takes
precedence.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Layouts are based on constraints, and normally, the parent passes those constraints to the children. The child *should* respect the constraints. However, that might not always be what the UI requires. There are ways to bypass this child behavior. For example, you can pass modifiers like `requiredSize` directly to the child, overriding the constraints received by the child from the parent, or you can use a custom layout with different behavior. When a child does not respect its constraints, the layout system will hide this from the parent. The parent will see the child's `width` and `height` values as if they were coerced in the constraints provided by the parent. The layout system will then center the child within the space allocated by the parent under the assumption that the child respected the constraints. Developers can override this centering behaviour by applying `wrapContentSize` modifiers to the child.

If you want a child layout to fill all the available height allowed by the
parent, add the `fillMaxHeight` modifier (Compose also provides
`fillMaxSize` and `fillMaxWidth`):


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.size(width = 400.dp, height = 100.dp)
    ) {
        Image(
            /*...*/
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxHeight()
        )
        Column { /*...*/ }
    }
}
```

<br />

![The image height is as big as its parent](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-fillmaxheight.png)

To add padding all around an element, set a [`padding`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).padding(androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp)) modifier.

If you want to add padding above a text baseline such that you achieve a
specific distance from the top of the layout to the baseline, use the
`paddingFromBaseline` modifier:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(artist: Artist) {
    Row(/*...*/) {
        Column {
            Text(
                text = artist.name,
                modifier = Modifier.paddingFromBaseline(top = 50.dp)
            )
            Text(artist.lastSeenOnline)
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

![Text with padding above it](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-paddingfrombaseline-new.png)

### Offset

To position a layout relative to its original position, add the
[`offset`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).offset(androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp,androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp)) modifier and set the offset in the **x** and **y** axis.
Offsets can be positive as well as non-positive. The difference between
`padding` and `offset` is that adding an `offset` to a composable does not
change its measurements:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(artist: Artist) {
    Row(/*...*/) {
        Column {
            Text(artist.name)
            Text(
                text = artist.lastSeenOnline,
                modifier = Modifier.offset(x = 4.dp)
            )
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

![Text shifted to the right side of its parent container](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-offset-new.png)

The `offset` modifier is applied horizontally according to the layout direction.
In a **left-to-right** context, a positive `offset` shifts the element to the
right, while in a **right-to-left** context, it shifts the element to the left.
If you need to set an offset without considering layout direction, see the
[`absoluteOffset`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#absoluteOffset(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp,androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp))
modifier, in which a positive offset value always shifts the element to the
right.

The `offset` modifier provides two overloads - [`offset`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).offset(androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp,androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp)) that takes the
offsets as parameters and [`offset`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).offset(kotlin.Function1)) that takes in a lambda.
For more in depth information on when to use each of these and how to optimize
for performance, read through the
[Compose performance - Defer reads as long as possible](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance#defer-reads) section.

## Scope safety in Compose

In Compose, there are modifiers that can only be used when applied to children
of certain composables. Compose enforces this by means of custom scopes.

For example, if you want to make a child as big as the parent `Box` without
affecting the `Box` size, use the
[`matchParentSize`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/BoxScope#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).matchParentSize())
modifier. `matchParentSize` is only available in
[`BoxScope`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/BoxScope).
Therefore, it can only be used on a child within a `Box` parent.

Scope safety prevents you from adding modifiers that wouldn't work in other
composables and scopes and saves time from trial and error.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** In the Android View system, there is no scope safety. Developers usually find themselves trying out different layout params to discover which ones are considered and their meaning in the context of a particular parent.

Scoped modifiers notify the parent about some information the parent
should know about the child. These are also commonly referred to as
*parent data modifiers*. Their internals are different from the general purpose
modifiers, but from a usage perspective, these differences don't matter.

### `matchParentSize` in `Box`

As mentioned above, if you want a child layout to be the same size as a parent
`Box` without affecting the `Box` size, use the `matchParentSize` modifier.

Note that `matchParentSize` is only available within a `Box` scope, meaning that
it only applies to *direct* children of `Box` composables.

In the example below, the child `Spacer` takes its size from its parent `Box`,
which in turn takes its size from the biggest children,
`ArtistCard` in this case.


```kotlin
@Composable
fun MatchParentSizeComposable() {
    Box {
        Spacer(
            Modifier
                .matchParentSize()
                .background(Color.LightGray)
        )
        ArtistCard()
    }
}
```

<br />

![Gray background filling its container](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-matchparentsize-new.png)

If `fillMaxSize` were used instead of `matchParentSize`, the `Spacer` would take
all the available space allowed to the parent, in turn causing the parent to
expand and fill all the available space.

![Gray background filling the screen](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-fillmaxsize.png)

### `weight` in `Row` and `Column`

As you have seen in the previous section on [Padding and
size](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/modifiers#padding-and-size), by default, a composable size is defined by the
content it is wrapping. You can set a composable size to be flexible within its
parent using the `weight` Modifier that is only available in `RowScope`, and
`ColumnScope`.

Let's take a `Row` that contains two `Box` composables.
The first box is given twice the `weight` of the second, so it's given twice the
width. Since the `Row` is `210.dp` wide, the first `Box` is `140.dp` wide, and
the second is `70.dp`:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ArtistCard(/*...*/) {
    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
    ) {
        Image(
            /*...*/
            modifier = Modifier.weight(2f)
        )
        Column(
            modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)
        ) {
            /*...*/
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

![The image width is twice text width](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layout-weight.png)

## Extracting and reusing modifiers

Multiple modifiers can be chained together to decorate or
augment a composable. This chain is created via the [`Modifier`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier) interface
which represents an ordered, immutable list of single [`Modifier.Elements`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier.Element).

Each `Modifier.Element` represents an individual behavior, like layout, drawing
and graphics behaviors, all gesture-related, focus and semantics behaviors, as
well as device input events. Their ordering matters: modifier elements that are
added first will be applied first.

Sometimes it can be beneficial to reuse the same modifier chain instances in
multiple composables, by extracting them into variables and hoisting them into
higher scopes. It can improve code readability or help improve your app's
performance for a few reasons:

- The re-allocation of the modifiers won't be repeated when recomposition occurs for composables that use them
- Modifier chains could potentially be very long and complex, so reusing the same instance of a chain can alleviate the workload Compose runtime needs to do when comparing them
- This extraction promotes code cleanliness, consistency and maintainability across the codebase

### Best practices for reusing modifiers

Create your own `Modifier` chains and extract them to reuse them on multiple
composable components. It is completely fine to just save a modifier, as they
are data-like objects:


```kotlin
val reusableModifier = Modifier
    .fillMaxWidth()
    .background(Color.Red)
    .padding(12.dp)
```

<br />

#### Extracting and reusing modifiers when observing frequently changing state

When observing frequently changing states inside composables, like animation
states or `scrollState`, there can be a significant amount of recompositions
done. In this case, your modifiers will get allocated on every recomposition
and potentially for every frame:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun LoadingWheelAnimation() {
    val animatedState = animateFloatAsState(/*...*/)

    LoadingWheel(
        // Creation and allocation of this modifier will happen on every frame of the animation!
        modifier = Modifier
            .padding(12.dp)
            .background(Color.Gray),
        animatedState = animatedState
    )
}
```

<br />

Instead, you can create, extract and reuse the same instance of the modifier
and pass it to the composable like this:


```kotlin
// Now, the allocation of the modifier happens here:
val reusableModifier = Modifier
    .padding(12.dp)
    .background(Color.Gray)

@Composable
fun LoadingWheelAnimation() {
    val animatedState = animateFloatAsState(/*...*/)

    LoadingWheel(
        // No allocation, as we're just reusing the same instance
        modifier = reusableModifier,
        animatedState = animatedState
    )
}
```

<br />

#### Extracting and reusing unscoped modifiers

Modifiers can be unscoped or scoped to a specific
composable. In the case of unscoped modifiers, you can easily extract them
outside of any composables as simple variables:


```kotlin
val reusableModifier = Modifier
    .fillMaxWidth()
    .background(Color.Red)
    .padding(12.dp)

@Composable
fun AuthorField() {
    HeaderText(
        // ...
        modifier = reusableModifier
    )
    SubtitleText(
        // ...
        modifier = reusableModifier
    )
}
```

<br />

This can be especially beneficial when combined with Lazy layouts. In most
cases, you'd want all of your, potentially significant, amount of items to have
the exact same modifiers:


```kotlin
val reusableItemModifier = Modifier
    .padding(bottom = 12.dp)
    .size(216.dp)
    .clip(CircleShape)

@Composable
private fun AuthorList(authors: List<Author>) {
    LazyColumn {
        items(authors) {
            AsyncImage(
                // ...
                modifier = reusableItemModifier,
            )
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

#### Extracting and reusing scoped modifiers

When dealing with modifiers that are scoped to certain composables, you can
extract them to the highest possible level and reuse where appropriate:


```kotlin
Column(/*...*/) {
    val reusableItemModifier = Modifier
        .padding(bottom = 12.dp)
        // Align Modifier.Element requires a ColumnScope
        .align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally)
        .weight(1f)
    Text1(
        modifier = reusableItemModifier,
        // ...
    )
    Text2(
        modifier = reusableItemModifier
        // ...
    )
    // ...
}
```

<br />

You should only be passing the extracted, scoped modifiers to the
same-scoped, direct children. See the section [Scope safety in
Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/modifiers#scope-safety) for more reference on why this matters:


```kotlin
Column(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {
    // Weight modifier is scoped to the Column composable
    val reusableItemModifier = Modifier.weight(1f)

    // Weight will be properly assigned here since this Text is a direct child of Column
    Text1(
        modifier = reusableItemModifier
        // ...
    )

    Box {
        Text2(
            // Weight won't do anything here since the Text composable is not a direct child of Column
            modifier = reusableItemModifier
            // ...
        )
    }
}
```

<br />

#### Further chaining of extracted modifiers

You can further chain or append your extracted modifier chains by calling the
[`.then()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier#then(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier)) function:


```kotlin
val reusableModifier = Modifier
    .fillMaxWidth()
    .background(Color.Red)
    .padding(12.dp)

// Append to your reusableModifier
reusableModifier.clickable { /*...*/ }

// Append your reusableModifier
otherModifier.then(reusableModifier)
```

<br />
