Insets provide information about the system UI to ensure that your app draws in
the correct area and your UI isn't obscured by the system UI. Learn how insets
communicate to your app where system decorations are placed, and how Compose
APIs help your content move with the system bars, software
keyboard, and the taskbar.  

## Key points

- *Insets* describe how much you need to pad the content of your app to avoid overlapping with parts of the system UI or physical device features.
- Different types of insets include the status bars, navigation bars, software keyboard, and more.
- Insets can change while your app is running, depending on the system configuration and windowing environment, such as device orientation, multi-window mode setup, or user controllable settings.
- Handle insets directly to make full use of the screen space and improve how your app looks and functions across form factors.
