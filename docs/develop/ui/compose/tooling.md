Android Studio provides a collection of tools to help you speed up UI design
using Jetpack Compose libraries. With the AI agent in Android Studio, you can
quickly go from a UI mock to a working prototype. Start working with the tools by first adding
the necessary dependencies to your Gradle file through the Bill of Materials
(BOM).

Quick Start
Add the Compose BOM and library dependencies using the quick start guide

## Tools for designing your UI

Create components, design systems, and layouts to align with design specs.

- [Preview UI](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/previews): Preview and interact with composables on various screen sizes, foldables, and multi-window configurations.
- [Preview animations](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/animation-preview): Inspect, debug, and preview animations frame by frame.

## Tools for developing and testing your UI

Accelerate building the UI and testing the running application with less context
switching.

- [Live Edit](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/iterative-development): Apply changes and see them in real time without doing full builds.
- [Editor actions](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/editor-actions): Use templates, gutter icons, and more in the Android Studio editor window.
- [Lint checks](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/lint): Verify the correctness of your Compose code.

## Tools for debugging your UI

Analyze layout, recompositions, and composition tracing to improve your app's UI
performance.

- [Layout Inspector](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/debug#layout_inspector): Inspect a Compose layout in an emulator or physical device.
- [Compose UI Check](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/debug#compose_ui_check): Inspect Compose UI for accessibility and adaptive issues to identify problems related to different display sizes, device orientations, and form factors.
- [Composition Tracing](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/tracing): Trace your composable functions in a system trace.
