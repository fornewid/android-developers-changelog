Developing with accessibility in mind means making your apps usable for
everyone, including people with accessibility needs, who may use Android devices
in many different ways. Compose provides a foundation for building more
accessible UIs with its declarative APIs and tools that help make your apps
more inclusive.

There are several key and supporting concepts in Compose accessibility:

- [**API defaults**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/api-defaults): Learn how Compose handles accessibility by default and how to leverage semantics and patterns to support accessibility from the start, and use them for custom components.
- [**Semantics**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/semantics): Understand the system of representing the meaning and role of UI elements for accessibility services, and how to choose appropriate semantics to represent properties like content types, descriptions, and states.
- [**Modify traversal order**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/traversal): Modify the order in which accessibility services navigate through elements on screen, which can be customized for better user experience.
- [**Support user-scalable content**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/scalable-content): Allow users to adjust the size of text and UI elements in your app to fit their needs.
- [**Merging and clearing**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/merging-clearing): Understand semantic merging and clearing strategies and APIs, and when it is appropriate to hide semantics from accessibility services.
- [**Inspect and debug**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/inspect-debug): Inspect your composables' accessibility semantics with tools and debug unexpected behaviors when using Android's assistive technologies.
- [**Testing**](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/testing): Detect common accessibility issues and automate some aspects of testing with Compose accessibility checks.
