Use `Modifier.flex` to control how an item changes size, order, and is aligned
inside a `FlexBox`.

## Item size

Use the `basis, grow`, and `shrink` properties to control an item's size.


```kotlin
FlexBox {
    RedRoundedBox(
        modifier = Modifier.flex {
            basis = FlexBasis.Auto
            grow = 1.0f
            shrink = 0.5f
        }
    )
}
```

<br />

### Set initial size

Use `basis` to specify the item's initial size before any extra space is
distributed. You can think of this as the item's *preferred* size.

|---|---|---|---|
| **Value type** | **Behavior** | **Code snippet** Note: The boxes have a maximum intrinsic size of `100dp` | **Example using container width `600dp`** |
| `Auto` (default) | Use the item's maximum intrinsic size. For example, a `Text` composable's maximum intrinsic width is the width of all its text on a single line - no wrapping. | ```kotlin FlexBox { RedRoundedBox( Modifier.flex { basis = FlexBasis.Auto } ) BlueRoundedBox( Modifier.flex { basis = FlexBasis.Auto } ) } ``` | ![Items sized based on their intrinsic size using basis Auto.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/initialsize-1.png) |
| Fixed `dp` | A fixed size in Dp. | ```kotlin FlexBox { RedRoundedBox( Modifier.flex { basis(200.dp) } ) BlueRoundedBox( Modifier.flex { basis(100.dp) } ) } ``` | ![Items sized to a fixed dp value using basis.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/initialsize-2.png) |
| Percentage | A percentage of the container size. | ```kotlin FlexBox { RedRoundedBox( Modifier.flex { basis(0.7f) } ) BlueRoundedBox( Modifier.flex { basis(0.3f) } ) } ``` | ![Items sized as a percentage of container size using basis.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/initialsize-3.png) |

If the basis value is less than the item's intrinsic minimum size, the intrinsic
minimum size is used instead. For example, if a `Text` item that contains a word
requires `50dp` to display, but also has `basis = 10.dp`, a
value of `50dp` is used.

### Grow items when there's space

Use `grow` to specify how much an item grows when there is extra space. This is
space remaining in the `FlexBox` container after all the items' `basis` values
have been added up. The `grow` value indicates *how much* of the extra space a
given child will receive, relative to its siblings. By default, items won't
grow.

The following example shows a `FlexBox` with three child items. Each has a basis
value of `100dp`. The first child has a positive `grow` value. Since there is
only one child with a `grow` value, the actual value is irrelevant - as long as
it's positive, the child receives all the extra space.

The images show the `FlexBox` behavior when its container size is `600dp`.

|---|---|
| ```kotlin FlexBox { RedRoundedBox( title = "400dp", modifier = Modifier.flex { grow = 1f } ) BlueRoundedBox(title = "100dp") GreenRoundedBox(title = "100dp") } ``` | Each child has a basis value of `100dp`. There is `300dp` of extra space. ![Three items with 100dp basis each, in a 600dp container, before growth.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/growitems-1.png) Child 1 grows by `300dp` to fill the extra space. ![First item grows to fill 300dp of extra space.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/growitems-2.png) |

In the following example, the container size and `basis` size are the same. The
difference is that each child has a different `grow` value.

|---|---|
| ```kotlin FlexBox { RedRoundedBox( title = "150dp", modifier = Modifier.flex { grow = 1f } ) BlueRoundedBox( title = "200dp", modifier = Modifier.flex { grow = 2f } ) GreenRoundedBox( title = "250dp", modifier = Modifier.flex { grow = 3f } ) } ``` | Each child has a basis value of `100dp`. There is `300dp` of extra space. ![Three items with 100dp basis each, in a 600dp container, before growth, with different grow values.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/growitems-3.png) The total grow value is 6. Child 1 grows by (1 / 6) \* 300 = `50dp` Child 2 grows by (2 / 6) \* 300 = `100dp` Child 3 grows by (3 / 6) \* 300 = `150dp` ![Items grow to fill 300dp of extra space based on relative grow values.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/growitems-4.png) |

### Shrink items when there's insufficient space

Use `shrink` to specify how much an item shrinks when the `FlexBox` container
has insufficient space for all the items. `shrink` works the same way as `grow`
except that, instead of distributing *extra space* to items, the *space deficit*
is distributed to items. The `shrink` value specifies how much of the space
deficit the item receives, or rather, how much the item will shrink by. By
default, items have a `shrink` value of `1f`, meaning they shrink equally.

The following example shows two `Text` composables with the same text. The first
child has a shrink value of `1f`, meaning it shrinks to absorb all the space
deficit.


```kotlin
FlexBox {
    Text(
        "The quick brown fox",
        fontSize = 36.sp,
        modifier = Modifier
            .background(PastelRed)
            .flex { shrink = 1f }
    )
    Text(
        "The quick brown fox",
        fontSize = 36.sp,
        modifier = Modifier
            .background(PastelBlue)
            .flex { shrink = 0f }
    )
}
```

<br />

As the container size shrinks, Child 1 shrinks.

|---|---|
| **Container size** | **FlexBox UI** |
| `700dp` | ![Two items in a 700dp container.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/containersize-1.png) |
| `500dp` | ![First item shrinks as container size reduces to 500dp.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/containersize-2.png) |
| `450dp` | ![First item shrinks further as container size reduces to 450dp.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/containersize-3.png) |

## Item alignment

Use `alignSelf` to control how an item is aligned to the cross axis. This
overrides the [`alignItems` property](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/flexbox/container-behavior#align-distribute) of the container for this item. It
has all the same possible values, with the addition of `Auto` which inherits the
behavior of the `FlexBox` container.

For example, this `FlexBox` has `alignItems` set to `Start` and five children
which override the cross axis alignment.


```kotlin
FlexBox(
    config = {
        alignItems = FlexAlignItems.Start
    }
) {
    RedRoundedBox()
    BlueRoundedBox(modifier = Modifier.flex { alignSelf = FlexAlignSelf.Center })
    GreenRoundedBox(modifier = Modifier.flex { alignSelf = FlexAlignSelf.End })
    PinkRoundedBox(modifier = Modifier.flex { alignSelf = FlexAlignSelf.Stretch })
    OrangeRoundedBox(modifier = Modifier.flex { alignSelf = FlexAlignSelf.Baseline })
}
```

<br />

## Item order

By default, `FlexBox` lays out items in the order that they are declared in
code. Override this behavior using `order`.

The default value for `order` is zero, and `FlexBox` sorts items based on this
value in ascending order. Any items that have the same `order` value are
laid out in the same order they are declared in. Use negative and positive
`order` values to move items to the start or end of a layout without changing
where they are declared.

The following example shows two child items. The first has the default `order`
of zero, and the second has an order of `-1`. After sorting, Child 1 appears
after Child 2.


```kotlin
FlexBox {
    // Declared first, but will be placed after visually
    RedRoundedBox(
        title = "World"
    )

    // Declared second, but will be placed first visually
    BlueRoundedBox(
        title = "Hello",
        modifier = Modifier.flex {
            order = -1
        }
    )
}
```
