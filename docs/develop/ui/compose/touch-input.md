Users interact with Android apps in various ways. For example, they can:

- Tap on a button with their finger.
- Navigate through a screen using their physical keyboard.
- Enter their email address using the on-screen keyboard.

Compose has a lot of built-in support for these use cases, but in some scenarios
you need to customize or extend the default behavior. In this section, you
learn more about [pointer input](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/pointer-input), [focus](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/focus), and [handling interactions](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/user-interactions/handling-interactions).
