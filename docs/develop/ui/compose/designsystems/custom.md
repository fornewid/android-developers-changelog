While Material is our recommended design system and Jetpack Compose ships an
implementation of Material, you are not forced to use it. Material is built
entirely on public APIs, so it's possible to create your own design system in
the same manner.

There are several approaches you might take:

- [Extend `MaterialTheme`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/custom#extending-material) with additional theming values.
- [Replace one or more Material systems](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/custom#replacing-systems) --- `Colors`, `Typography`, or `Shapes` --- with custom implementations while keeping the others.
- [Implement a fully custom design system](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/custom#implementing-fully-custom) to replace `MaterialTheme`.

You may also want to continue using Material components with a custom design
system. It's possible to do this but there are things to keep in mind to suit
the approach you've taken.

To learn more about the lower-level constructs and APIs used by `MaterialTheme`
and custom design systems, check out the [Anatomy of a theme in Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/anatomy) guide.

## Extend Material Theming

Compose Material closely models
[Material Theming](https://m3.material.io/)
to make it straightforward and type-safe to follow the Material guidelines.
However, it's possible to extend the color, typography, and shape sets with
additional values. The simplest approach is to add extension properties:


```kotlin
// Use with MaterialTheme.colorScheme.snackbarAction
val ColorScheme.snackbarAction: Color
    @Composable
    get() = if (isSystemInDarkTheme()) Red300 else Red700

// Use with MaterialTheme.typography.textFieldInput
val Typography.textFieldInput: TextStyle
    get() = TextStyle(/* ... */)

// Use with MaterialTheme.shapes.card
val Shapes.card: Shape
    get() = RoundedCornerShape(size = 20.dp)
```

<br />

This provides consistency with `MaterialTheme` usage APIs. An example of this
defined by Compose itself is
[`surfaceColorAtElevation`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary#(androidx.compose.material3.ColorScheme).surfaceColorAtElevation(androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp)),
which determines the surface color that should be used depending on the
elevation.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** This approach is only recommended for straightforward theming value additions, or for values that are the same in different themes. If you have multiple themes, it's better to define a class with new properties instead.

Another approach is to define an extended theme that "wraps" `MaterialTheme` and
its values.

Suppose you want to add two additional colors --- `caution` and `onCaution`, a
yellow color used for actions that are semi-dangerous --- whilst keeping the
existing Material colors:


```kotlin
@Immutable
data class ExtendedColors(
    val caution: Color,
    val onCaution: Color
)

val LocalExtendedColors = staticCompositionLocalOf {
    ExtendedColors(
        caution = Color.Unspecified,
        onCaution = Color.Unspecified
    )
}

@Composable
fun ExtendedTheme(
    /* ... */
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    val extendedColors = ExtendedColors(
        caution = Color(0xFFFFCC02),
        onCaution = Color(0xFF2C2D30)
    )
    CompositionLocalProvider(LocalExtendedColors provides extendedColors) {
        MaterialTheme(
            /* colors = ..., typography = ..., shapes = ... */
            content = content
        )
    }
}

// Use with eg. ExtendedTheme.colors.caution
object ExtendedTheme {
    val colors: ExtendedColors
        @Composable
        get() = LocalExtendedColors.current
}
```

<br />

This is similar to `MaterialTheme` usage APIs. It also supports multiple themes
as you can nest `ExtendedTheme`s in the same way as `MaterialTheme`.

### Use Material components

When extending Material Theming, existing `MaterialTheme` values are maintained
and Material components still have reasonable defaults.

If you want to use extended values in components, wrap them in your own
composable functions, directly setting the values you want to alter, and
exposing others as parameters to the containing composable:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ExtendedButton(
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit
) {
    Button(
        colors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors(
            containerColor = ExtendedTheme.colors.caution,
            contentColor = ExtendedTheme.colors.onCaution
            /* Other colors use values from MaterialTheme */
        ),
        onClick = onClick,
        modifier = modifier,
        content = content
    )
}
```

<br />

You would then replace usages of `Button` with `ExtendedButton` where
appropriate.


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ExtendedApp() {
    ExtendedTheme {
        /*...*/
        ExtendedButton(onClick = { /* ... */ }) {
            /* ... */
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

## Replace Material subsystems

Instead of extending Material Theming, you may want to replace one or more
systems --- `Colors`, `Typography`, or `Shapes` --- with a custom implementation,
while maintaining the others.

Suppose you want to replace the type and shape systems while keeping the color
system:


```kotlin
@Immutable
data class ReplacementTypography(
    val body: TextStyle,
    val title: TextStyle
)

@Immutable
data class ReplacementShapes(
    val component: Shape,
    val surface: Shape
)

val LocalReplacementTypography = staticCompositionLocalOf {
    ReplacementTypography(
        body = TextStyle.Default,
        title = TextStyle.Default
    )
}
val LocalReplacementShapes = staticCompositionLocalOf {
    ReplacementShapes(
        component = RoundedCornerShape(ZeroCornerSize),
        surface = RoundedCornerShape(ZeroCornerSize)
    )
}

@Composable
fun ReplacementTheme(
    /* ... */
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    val replacementTypography = ReplacementTypography(
        body = TextStyle(fontSize = 16.sp),
        title = TextStyle(fontSize = 32.sp)
    )
    val replacementShapes = ReplacementShapes(
        component = RoundedCornerShape(percent = 50),
        surface = RoundedCornerShape(size = 40.dp)
    )
    CompositionLocalProvider(
        LocalReplacementTypography provides replacementTypography,
        LocalReplacementShapes provides replacementShapes
    ) {
        MaterialTheme(
            /* colors = ... */
            content = content
        )
    }
}

// Use with eg. ReplacementTheme.typography.body
object ReplacementTheme {
    val typography: ReplacementTypography
        @Composable
        get() = LocalReplacementTypography.current
    val shapes: ReplacementShapes
        @Composable
        get() = LocalReplacementShapes.current
}
```

<br />

### Use Material components

When one or more systems of `MaterialTheme` have been replaced, using Material
components as-is may result in unwanted Material color, type, or shape values.

If you want to use replacement values in components, wrap them in your own
composable functions, directly setting the values for the relevant system, and
exposing others as parameters to the containing composable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Not all values may be exposed as parameters in Material composables, in particular with `CompositionLocal` composables (such as `LocalTextStyle`). In such cases you may need to wrap `content` lambdas in provider functions (like `ProvideTextStyle`).


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ReplacementButton(
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit
) {
    Button(
        shape = ReplacementTheme.shapes.component,
        onClick = onClick,
        modifier = modifier,
        content = {
            ProvideTextStyle(
                value = ReplacementTheme.typography.body
            ) {
                content()
            }
        }
    )
}
```

<br />

You would then replace usages of `Button` with `ReplacementButton` where
appropriate.


```kotlin
@Composable
fun ReplacementApp() {
    ReplacementTheme {
        /*...*/
        ReplacementButton(onClick = { /* ... */ }) {
            /* ... */
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

## Implement a fully custom design system

You may want to replace Material Theming with a fully custom design system.
Consider that `MaterialTheme` provides the following systems:

- `Colors`, `Typography`, and `Shapes`: Material Theming systems
- `TextSelectionColors`: Colors used for text selection by `Text` and `TextField`
- `Ripple` and `RippleTheme`: Material implementation of `Indication`

If you want to continue using Material components, you must replace some of
these systems in your custom themes or handle the systems in your
components to avoid unwanted behavior.

However, design systems are not limited to the concepts Material relies on. You
can modify existing systems and introduce entirely new ones --- with new classes
and types --- to make other concepts compatible with themes.

In the following code, we model a custom color system that includes gradients
(`List<Color>`), include a type system, introduce a new elevation system,
and exclude other systems provided by `MaterialTheme`:

![Screenshot of a mobile app UI demonstrating a custom design system with elements using gradients for colors, custom typography, and elevation.](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/themes/custom-color-gradients.png)


```kotlin
@Immutable
data class CustomColors(
    val content: Color,
    val component: Color,
    val background: List<Color>
)

@Immutable
data class CustomTypography(
    val body: TextStyle,
    val title: TextStyle
)

@Immutable
data class CustomElevation(
    val default: Dp,
    val pressed: Dp
)

val LocalCustomColors = staticCompositionLocalOf {
    CustomColors(
        content = Color.Unspecified,
        component = Color.Unspecified,
        background = emptyList()
    )
}
val LocalCustomTypography = staticCompositionLocalOf {
    CustomTypography(
        body = TextStyle.Default,
        title = TextStyle.Default
    )
}
val LocalCustomElevation = staticCompositionLocalOf {
    CustomElevation(
        default = Dp.Unspecified,
        pressed = Dp.Unspecified
    )
}

@Composable
fun CustomTheme(
    /* ... */
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    val customColors = CustomColors(
        content = Color(0xFFDD0D3C),
        component = Color(0xFFC20029),
        background = listOf(Color.White, Color(0xFFF8BBD0))
    )
    val customTypography = CustomTypography(
        body = TextStyle(fontSize = 16.sp),
        title = TextStyle(fontSize = 32.sp)
    )
    val customElevation = CustomElevation(
        default = 4.dp,
        pressed = 8.dp
    )
    CompositionLocalProvider(
        LocalCustomColors provides customColors,
        LocalCustomTypography provides customTypography,
        LocalCustomElevation provides customElevation,
        content = content
    )
}

// Use with eg. CustomTheme.elevation.small
object CustomTheme {
    val colors: CustomColors
        @Composable
        get() = LocalCustomColors.current
    val typography: CustomTypography
        @Composable
        get() = LocalCustomTypography.current
    val elevation: CustomElevation
        @Composable
        get() = LocalCustomElevation.current
}
```

<br />

### Use Material components

When no `MaterialTheme` is present, using Material components as-is will result
in unwanted Material color, type, and shape values and indication behavior.

If you want to use custom values in components, wrap them in your own composable
functions, directly setting the values for the relevant system, and exposing
others as parameters to the containing composable.

We recommend that you access values you set from your custom theme.
Alternatively, if your theme doesn't provide `Color`, `TextStyle`, `Shape`, or
other systems, you can hardcode them.


```kotlin
@Composable
fun CustomButton(
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit
) {
    Button(
        colors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors(
            containerColor = CustomTheme.colors.component,
            contentColor = CustomTheme.colors.content,
            disabledContainerColor = CustomTheme.colors.content
                .copy(alpha = 0.12f)
                .compositeOver(CustomTheme.colors.component),
            disabledContentColor = CustomTheme.colors.content
                .copy(alpha = 0.38f)

        ),
        shape = ButtonShape,
        elevation = ButtonDefaults.elevatedButtonElevation(
            defaultElevation = CustomTheme.elevation.default,
            pressedElevation = CustomTheme.elevation.pressed
            /* disabledElevation = 0.dp */
        ),
        onClick = onClick,
        modifier = modifier,
        content = {
            ProvideTextStyle(
                value = CustomTheme.typography.body
            ) {
                content()
            }
        }
    )
}

val ButtonShape = RoundedCornerShape(percent = 50)
```

<br />

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `Button` uses `rememberRipple()` internally to provide a `Ripple` `Indication`. It's a good idea to check the source code when implementing other custom components that wrap existing components.

If you've introduced new class types --- such as `List<Color>` to represent
gradients --- then it may be better to implement components from scratch instead
of wrapping them. For an example, take a look at
[`JetsnackButton`](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/blob/main/Jetsnack/app/src/main/java/com/example/jetsnack/ui/components/Button.kt)
from the Jetsnack sample.
