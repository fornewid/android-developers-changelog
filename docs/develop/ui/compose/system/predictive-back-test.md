If you still use Android 13 or Android 14, you can test the back-to-home
animation.

To test this animation, follow these steps:

1. On your device, go to **Settings \> System \> Developer options**.
2. Select **Predictive back animations**.
3. Launch your updated app, and use the back gesture to see it in action.

On Android 15 and later, this feature is enabled by default.
