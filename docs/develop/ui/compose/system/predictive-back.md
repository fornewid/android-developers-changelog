Predictive back, a gesture navigation feature, lets users preview where the
back swipe takes them. Predictive back seamlessly integrates with Compose to
enhance your app's navigation experience. Users enjoy smoother and more
intuitive transitions when navigating back within your app. Figure 1 shows how
this works in the [SociaLite](https://github.com/android/socialite) sample app.
