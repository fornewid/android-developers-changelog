Be sure to test all of your app's screens and experiences. Test on devices with
different types of cutouts, if possible. If you don't have a device with a
cutout, you can simulate common cutout configurations on any device or emulator
running Android 9 or higher by doing the following:

1. Enable [**Developer options**](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
2. In the **Developer options** screen, scroll down to the **Drawing** section and select **Simulate a display with a cutout**.
3. Select the cutout type. ![simulating a display cutout in the emulator](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/system/cutouts_testing_developer_options.png) **Figure 3** . Use **Developer options** to test how your content renders.
