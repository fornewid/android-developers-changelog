Android 16 includes additional metrics APIs that are more granular. These
metrics track tap actions such as a button click, scroll, impressions, and the
widget's size and position.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Testing widget engagement metrics requires a compileSdk of 36.1 or higher and a device running Android 16 or higher. Test with a physical device for the best results. For more information, see [Get Android 16 QPR2 Beta on a Google Pixel device](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/get).

The main API is [`AppWidgetEvent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetEvent#getClickedIds%28%29). Use `WorkManager` to create a periodic
worker that captures widget engagement, whether daily, weekly, or whenever
your app is opened.

See the following snippet for an example of tracking clicks, scrolls and
impression length.


```kotlin
@RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES_FULL.BAKLAVA_1)
fun getWidgetEngagementMetrics(context: Context) {
    val manager = AppWidgetManager.getInstance(context)

    val endTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    val startTime = endTime - (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // a day ago

    val events = manager.queryAppWidgetEvents(startTime, endTime)

    if (events.isEmpty()) {
        Log.d(TAG, "No events found for the given time range.")
    }

    val metrics = hashMapOf(
        "clicks" to 0L,
        "scrolls" to 0L,
        "totalImpressionLength" to 0L
    )

    for (event in events) {

        Log.d(TAG, "Event Start: ${event.start}")
        Log.d(TAG, "Event End: ${event.end}")

        val widgetId = event.appWidgetId

        // Tap actions
        val clickedIds = event.clickedIds
        if (clickedIds?.isNotEmpty() == true) {
            metrics["clicks"] = metrics.getValue("clicks") + clickedIds.size
            // Log or analyze which components were clicked.
            for (id in clickedIds) {
                Log.d(TAG, "Widget $widgetId: Tap event on component with ID $id")
            }
        }

        // Scroll events
        val scrolledIds = event.scrolledIds
        if (scrolledIds?.isNotEmpty() == true) {
            metrics["scrolls"] = metrics.getValue("scrolls") + scrolledIds.size
            // Log or analyze which lists were scrolled.
            for (id in scrolledIds) {
                Log.d(TAG, "Widget $widgetId: Scroll event in list with ID/tag $id")
            }
        }

        // Impressions
        metrics["totalImpressionLength"] = metrics.getValue("totalImpressionLength") + event.visibleDuration.toMillis()
        Log.d(
            TAG,
            "Widget $widgetId: Impression event with duration " + event.visibleDuration.toMillis() + "ms"
        )

        // Position
        val position = event.position
        if (position != null) {
            Log.d(
                TAG,
                "Widget $widgetId: left=${position.left}, right=${position.right}, top=${position.top}, bottom=${position.bottom}"
            )
        }
    }
    Log.d("WidgetMetrics", "Metrics: $metrics")
}
```

To preserve system health, events are reported once an hour by default although
device manufacturers may change the reporting window. For example, on Pixel
devices if a user scrolls the same list in your widget 10 times in an hour, only
1 scroll event will be counted for that hour.

For testing, you can set the following attribute to a specified time and restart
your test device. In the following example, the report window is set to 0 ms and
events are reported immediately.

    adb shell device_config override systemui widget_events_report_interval_ms 0

In order to set a custom tag for reporting clicks and scrolls, you can use
[RemoteViews.setAppWidgetEventTag](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RemoteViews#setAppWidgetEventTag(int,%20int)) on a view within your `RemoteViews`
layout. This integer tag is used when you query for `AppWidgetEvents` that
include clicks or scrolls on this view.
