# Enable users to configure app widgets Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.





Design your widget so that users can configure specific traits. For example, a
clock widget can let users configure which time zone to display.

If you want to let users configure your widget's settings, create a widget
configuration [`Activity`](/reference/android/app/Activity). This activity is automatically launched by the
app widget host either when the widget is created or later, depending on the
[configuration options](#widget-config-options) you specify.

## Declare the configuration activity

Declare the configuration activity as a normal activity in the Android manifest
file. The app widget host launches it with the [`ACTION_APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE`](/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetManager#ACTION_APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE)
action, so the activity needs to accept this intent. For example:

```
<activity android:name=".ExampleAppWidgetConfigurationActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Declare the activity in the `AppWidgetProviderInfo.xml` file with the
`android:configure` attribute. See more information about [declaring this
file](/develop/ui/compose/glance/create-app-widget#AppWidgetProviderInfo). Here's an example of how to declare the configuration activity:

```
<appwidget-provider xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    ...
    android:configure="com.example.android.ExampleAppWidgetConfigurationActivity"
    ... >
</appwidget-provider>
```

The activity is declared with a fully qualified namespace, because the launcher
references it from outside your package scope.

That's all you need to start a configuration activity. Next, you need to
implement the actual activity.

## Implement the configuration activity

There are two important points to remember when you implement the activity:

* The app widget host calls the configuration activity, and the configuration
  activity must always return a result. The result must include the App Widget
  ID passed by the intent that launched the activity saved in the intent
  extras as [`EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID`](/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetManager#EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID).
  + The system doesn't send the [`ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE`](/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetManager#ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE) broadcast
    when a configuration activity is launched, which means it doesn't call
    your widget updates initially when the widget is created. It's the
    responsibility of the configuration activity to request an update from
    the `GlanceAppWidget` when creating the widget for the first time.
    However, updates are triggered automatically for subsequent cycles.

See the code snippets in the following section for an example of how to return a
result from the configuration and update the Glance widget.

### Update the widget from the configuration activity

When a widget uses a configuration activity, it's the responsibility of the
activity to update the widget when configuration is complete. You can do so by
triggering a manual update directly from the `GlanceAppWidget` instance.

Here's a summary of the procedure to properly update the widget and close the
configuration activity:

1. Get the App Widget ID from the intent that launched the activity:

   ```
   val appWidgetId = intent?.extras?.getInt(
           AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID,
           AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID
   ) ?: AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID
   ```
2. Set the activity result to `RESULT_CANCELED`.

   This way, if the user backs out of the activity before reaching the end, the
   system notifies the app widget host that the configuration is canceled and
   the host doesn't add the widget:

   ```
   val resultValue = Intent().putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, appWidgetId)
   setResult(Activity.RESULT_CANCELED, resultValue)
   ```
3. Configure the widget according to the user's preferences, for example
   writing the selections to persistent Datastore or a local database.
4. When the configuration is complete, retrieve the `GlanceId` corresponding to
   the platform widget ID:

   ```
   val glanceAppWidgetManager = GlanceAppWidgetManager(context)
   val glanceId = glanceAppWidgetManager.getGlanceIdBy(appWidgetId)
   ```
5. Update the widget content by calling the `update` suspend function on your
   `GlanceAppWidget` instance:

   ```
   // Update the GlanceAppWidget directly
   ExampleGlanceWidget().update(context, glanceId)
   ```
6. Create the return intent, set it with the activity result, and finish the
   activity:

   ```
   val resultValue = Intent().putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, appWidgetId)
   setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, resultValue)
   finish()
   ```

## Widget configuration options

By default, the app widget host only launches the configuration activity once,
immediately after the user adds the widget to their home screen. However, you
can specify options that let the user reconfigure existing widgets or skip
initial widget configuration by providing a default widget configuration.

**Note:** These options are only available starting in Android 12 (API level 31).
You can specify them for previous versions of Android, but the system ignores
them and follows the default behavior.

### Enable users to reconfigure placed widgets

To let users reconfigure existing widgets, specify the [`reconfigurable`](/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProviderInfo#WIDGET_FEATURE_RECONFIGURABLE)
flag in the [`widgetFeatures`](/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProviderInfo#widgetFeatures) attribute of `appwidget-provider`. For
example:

```
<appwidget-provider
    android:configure="com.myapp.ExampleAppWidgetConfigurationActivity"
    android:widgetFeatures="reconfigurable">
</appwidget-provider>
```

Users can reconfigure their widget by touching & holding the widget and tapping
the **Reconfigure** button, which is labeled 1 in figure 1.

### Use the widget's default configuration

You can provide a more seamless widget experience by letting users skip the
initial configuration step. To do this, specify both the
[`configuration_optional`](/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProviderInfo#WIDGET_FEATURE_CONFIGURATION_OPTIONAL) and `reconfigurable` flags in the `widgetFeatures`
field. This bypasses launching the configuration activity after a user adds the
widget. As mentioned previously, the user can still [reconfigure the widget](#reconfigure-widgets)
afterward. For example, a clock widget can bypass the initial configuration and
show the device time zone by default.

Here is an example of how to mark your configuration activity as both
reconfigurable and optional:

```
<appwidget-provider
    android:configure="com.myapp.ExampleAppWidgetConfigurationActivity"
    android:widgetFeatures="reconfigurable|configuration_optional">
</appwidget-provider>
```
