With Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, you can let users pin your
widgets to their home screen within your app. Promoting widgets directly within
your app is a great way to increase user engagement, especially after a
user completes a related task, or when a user repeatedly accesses a feature in
your app.

## Create a Pin Request

To initiate widget pinning, use the [`requestPinGlanceAppWidget`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/glance/appwidget/GlanceAppWidgetManager#requestPinGlanceAppWidget(java.lang.Class,androidx.glance.appwidget.GlanceAppWidget,kotlin.Any,android.app.PendingIntent)) method
from the [`GlanceAppWidgetManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/glance/appwidget/GlanceAppWidgetManager) class. For apps running on lower versions
of Android, this returns false. However if the request is successfully sent
to the system, this returns true.

Here is an example of how you can create a pin request:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun AnInAppComposable() {
    val context = LocalContext.current
    val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    Button(
        onClick = {
            coroutineScope.launch {
                GlanceAppWidgetManager(context).requestPinGlanceAppWidget(
                    receiver = MyWidgetReceiver::class.java,
                    preview = MyWidget(),
                    previewState = DpSize(245.dp, 115.dp)
                )
            }
        }
    ) {}
}
```

<br />

In this example, `MyWidgetReceiver` is the class that receives the widget's
callbacks, and `MyWidget` is the Glance widget you want to pin. The
`successCallback` is a `PendingIntent` that is triggered when the widget is
successfully pinned.

## Handle the Pin Request Response

When a user responds to the pin request dialog, your app receives a
response. If the user accepts the request, your widget is pinned to their
home screen, and the `successCallback` `PendingIntent` is triggered. If the
user denies the request, nothing happens.

It is important to note that the `successCallback` is only triggered if the
widget is successfully added to the home screen. It is not triggered if the user
denies the request or if the launcher does not support pinning.
