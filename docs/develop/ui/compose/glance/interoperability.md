In some cases, you may want to use XML and `RemoteViews` to provide a view.
Perhaps you have already implemented a feature without Glance, or the feature is
not yet available or possible with the current Glance API. For these situations,
Glance provides `AndroidRemoteViews`, an interoperability API.

The `AndroidRemoteViews` composable allows `RemoteViews` to be placed together
with your other composables:


```kotlin
val packageName = LocalContext.current.packageName
Column(modifier = GlanceModifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    Text("Isn't that cool?")
    AndroidRemoteViews(RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.example_layout))
}
```

<br />

Create and define the `RemoteViews` as you would without Glance, and simply pass
it as a parameter.

In addition, you can create `RemoteViews` containers for your composables:


```kotlin
AndroidRemoteViews(
    remoteViews = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.my_container_view),
    containerViewId = R.id.example_view
) {
    Column(modifier = GlanceModifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        Text("My title")
        Text("Maybe a long content...")
    }
}
```

<br />

In this case, a layout that contains the "container" is passed with the defined
ID. This container must be a [`ViewGroup`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup), since it is used to place the
defined content.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Any children of the defined container are removed and replaced with the content. Also, the provided `ViewGroup` must be supported by `RemoteViews.` See [`RemoteViewsWidget.kt`](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:glance/glance-appwidget/integration-tests/demos/src/main/java/androidx/glance/appwidget/demos/RemoteViewsWidget.kt) for an example of using `AndroidRemoteViews`.
