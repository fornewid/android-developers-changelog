Jetpack Compose was designed with View interoperability right from the start---you
can use Compose within Views, and vice versa. This functionality allows you
to adopt Compose in your existing View-based app without having to rewrite it
from scratch.

The following pages describe how to integrate Compose with your existing apps:

- [Migration strategy](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/strategy): Learn the strategy to safely and incrementally introduce Compose into your codebase.
- [Interoperability APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis): Learn about Compose's APIs to help you combine Compose with View-based UI.
- [Other considerations](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/other-considerations): Learn other considerations like theming, architecture, and testing while migrating your View-based app to Compose.
