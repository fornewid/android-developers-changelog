If you have an existing View-based app, you may not want to rewrite its entire
UI all at once. This page helps you add new Compose components into your
existing app. To get started with using Compose in your app, see [Set up Compose
for an existing app](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/setup#setup-compose).

Jetpack Compose was designed with View interoperability right from the start.
This functionality means you can migrate your existing View-based app to Compose
while still being able to build new features. To migrate to Compose, we
recommend an incremental migration where Compose and Views co-exist in your
codebase until your app is fully in Compose.
![The stages of a View-based app’s migration to Compose](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/interop-stages.png) **Figure 1**. The stages of a View-based app's migration to Compose

To migrate your app to Compose, follow these steps:

1. Build new screens with Compose.
2. As you're building features, identify reusable elements and start to create a library of common UI components.
3. Replace existing features one screen at a time.

## Build new screens with Compose

Using Compose to build new features that encompass an entire screen is the best
way to drive your adoption of Compose. With this strategy, you can add features
and take advantage of the [benefits of Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/why-adopt) while still catering to your
company's business needs.
![A new screen written in Compose](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/interop-newscreen.png) **Figure 2**. A new screen written in Compose

When you use Compose to build new screens in your existing app, you're still
working under the constraints of your app's architecture. If you are using
Fragments and the Navigation component, then you would have to create a new
Fragment and have its contents in Compose.

To use Compose in a Fragment, return a [`ComposeView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/platform/ComposeView) in the
`onCreateView()` lifecycle method of your Fragment. `ComposeView` has a
`setContent()` method where you can provide a composable function.


```kotlin
class NewFeatureFragment : Fragment() {
    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View {
        return ComposeView(requireContext()).apply {
            setViewCompositionStrategy(ViewCompositionStrategy.DisposeOnViewTreeLifecycleDestroyed)
            setContent {
                NewFeatureScreen()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See [ComposeView in Fragments](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis/views-in-compose#compose-in-fragments) to learn more.

### Add new features in existing screens

![An existing screen with mixed Views and Compose](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/interop-existingscreen.png) **Figure 3**. An existing screen with mixed Views and Compose

You can also use Compose in an existing View-based screen if the new feature you
are adding is part of an existing screen. To do so, add a `ComposeView` to the
View hierarchy, just like any other View.

For example, say you want to add a child view to a `LinearLayout`. You can do so
in XML as follows:

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

  <TextView
      android:id="@+id/text"
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

  <androidx.compose.ui.platform.ComposeView
      android:id="@+id/compose_view"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="match_parent" />
</LinearLayout>
```

Once the view has been inflated, you can later reference the `ComposeView` in
the hierarchy and call `setContent()`.

To learn more about `ComposeView`, check out [Interoperability APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis).

## Build a library of common UI components

As you're building features with Compose, you'll quickly realize that you end up
building a library of components. Creating a library of common UI components
allows you to have a single source of truth for these components in your app and
promote reusability. Features you build can then depend on this library. This
technique is especially useful if you are building a [custom design system in
Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/custom).

Depending on your app's size, this library could be a separate package, module,
or library module. For more information on organizing modules in your app, check
out the [Guide to Android app modularization](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization).

## Replace existing features with Compose

In addition to using Compose to build new features, you'll want to gradually
migrate existing features in your app to take advantage of Compose.

Having your app be Compose-only can accelerate your development and also
reduce the APK size and build times of your app. See [Compare Compose and View
performance](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/compare-metrics) to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Rely on UI testing to ensure you are not introducing regressions during migration. See [Test apps on Android](https://developer.android.com/training/testing) and [Testing your Compose layout](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing) to learn more about UI testing.

### Simple screens

The first places to look when migrating existing features to Compose are simple
screens. Simple screens can be a welcome screen, a confirmation screen, or a
setting screen wherein the data displayed in the UI is relatively static.

Take the following XML file:

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

  <TextView
      android:id="@+id/title_text"
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:text="@string/title"
      android:textAppearance="?attr/textAppearanceHeadline2" />

  <TextView
      android:id="@+id/subtitle_text"
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:text="@string/subtitle"
      android:textAppearance="?attr/textAppearanceHeadline6" />

  <TextView
      android:id="@+id/body_text"
      android:layout_width="wrap_content"
      android:layout_height="0dp"
      android:layout_weight="1"
      android:text="@string/body"
      android:textAppearance="?attr/textAppearanceBody1" />

  <Button
      android:id="@+id/confirm_button"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:text="@string/confirm"/>
</LinearLayout>
```

The XML file can be rewritten in Compose in a few lines:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun SimpleScreen() {
    Column(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        Text(
            text = stringResource(R.string.title),
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineMedium
        )
        Text(
            text = stringResource(R.string.subtitle),
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall
        )
        Text(
            text = stringResource(R.string.body),
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.bodyMedium
        )
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.weight(1f))
        Button(onClick = { /* Handle click */ }, Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {
            Text(text = stringResource(R.string.confirm))
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

### Mixed view and Compose screens

A screen that already contains a bit of Compose code is another good candidate
for migrating entirely to Compose. Depending on the complexity of the screen,
you can either migrate it entirely to Compose, or do it piece-by-piece. If the
screen started with Compose in a subtree of the UI hierarchy, you would continue
migrating UI elements until the entire screen is in Compose. This approach is
also called the *bottom-up* approach.
![Bottom-up approach of migrating a mixed Views and Compose UI to Compose](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/interop-animation.gif) **Figure 4**. Bottom-up approach of migrating a mixed Views and Compose UI to Compose

## Removing Fragments and Navigation component

You can migrate to [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation) once you're able to remove all of
your Fragments and replace with corresponding screen-level composables. Screen-level
composables can contain a [mix of Compose and View content](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis/views-in-compose), but all
navigation destinations must be composables to enable Navigation Compose
migration. Until then, you should continue using
[Fragment-based Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) in your mixed View and Compose
codebase. See [Migrate Jetpack Navigation to Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/migration-scenarios/navigation) for
more information.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Using Navigation Compose in a Compose-only app is not a prerequisite. You can continue using [Fragment-based Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started), as long as you keep Fragments for [hosting your composable content](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis/compose-in-views).
