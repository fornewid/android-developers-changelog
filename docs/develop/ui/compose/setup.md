For the best experience developing with Compose, download and install [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). It includes many [smart editor features](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling), such as new project
templates and the ability to immediately preview your Compose UI and animations.

[Get Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Follow these instructions to create a new Compose app project, set up
Compose for an existing app project, or import a sample app written in Compose.

## Create a new app with support for Compose

If you want to start a new project that includes support for Compose by default,
Android Studio includes various project templates to help you get started. To
create a new project that has Compose setup correctly, proceed as follows:

1. If you're in the **Welcome to Android Studio** window, click **Start a new
   Android Studio project** . If you already have an Android Studio project open , select **File \> New \> New Project** from the menu bar.
2. In the **Select a Project Template** window, select **Empty
   Activity** and click **Next**.
3. In the **Configure your project** window, do the following:
   1. Set the **Name, Package name** , and **Save location** as you normally would. Note that, in the **Language** dropdown menu, **Kotlin** is the only available option because Jetpack Compose works only with classes written in Kotlin.
   2. In the **Minimum API level dropdown** menu, select API level 21 or higher.
4. Click **Finish**.

Now you're ready to start developing an app using Jetpack Compose. To help you
get started and learn about what you can do with the toolkit, try the [Jetpack
Compose tutorial](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tutorial).

## Setup Compose dependencies and Compiler

See [Setup Compose dependencies and Compiler](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/setup-compose-dependencies-and-compiler).

## Try Jetpack Compose sample apps

The fastest way to experiment with the capabilities of Jetpack Compose is by
trying [Jetpack Compose sample apps](https://github.com/android/compose-samples) hosted on GitHub. To import
a sample app project from Android Studio, proceed as follows:

1. If you're in the **Welcome to Android Studio** window, select **Import an
   Android code sample** . If you already have an Android Studio project open, select **File \> New \> Import Sample** from the menu bar.
2. In the search bar near the top of the **Browse Samples** wizard, type "compose".
3. Select one of the Jetpack Compose sample apps from the search results and click **Next**.
4. Either change the **Application name** and **Project location** or keep the default values.
5. Click **Finish**.

Android Studio downloads the sample app to the path you specified and opens the
project. You can then inspect `MainActivity.kt` in each of the examples to see
Jetpack Compose APIs such as crossfade animation, custom components, using
typography, and displaying light and dark colors in the in-IDE preview.

To use Jetpack Compose for Wear OS, see [Set up Jetpack Compose on Wear OS](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/compose-setup).
