Test your app's UI to verify that behavior of your Compose code is
correct. This lets you catch errors early and improve the quality of your app.

Compose provides a set of testing APIs to find elements, verify their
attributes, and perform user actions. The APIs also include advanced features
such as time manipulation. Use these APIs to create robust tests that verify
your app's behavior.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** For more on testing Android apps in general, including testing `View` elements, see the [general testing section](https://developer.android.com/training/testing). A good place to start is the [Fundamentals of testing Android apps](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/fundamentals) guide.

## Views

If you are working with views instead of Compose, see the general [Test apps on
Android](https://developer.android.com/training/testing) section.

In particular, a good place to start is the [Automate UI tests](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-tests) guide. It
lays out how you can automate tests that run on-device, including when using
views.

## Key Concepts

The following are some key concepts for testing your Compose code:

- **[Semantics](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/semantics)**: Semantics give meaning to your UI, allowing tests to interact with specific elements.
- **[Testing APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/apis)**: Testing APIs let you find elements, verify their attributes, and perform user actions.
- **[Synchronization](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/synchronization)**: Synchronization verifies that tests wait for the UI to be idle before performing actions or making assertions.
- **[Interoperability](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/interoperability)**: Interoperability enables tests to work with both Compose and View-based elements in the same app.

## Testing cheatsheet

See the [testing cheatsheet](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/testing-cheatsheet) for an overview of all the key topics you should
learn about testing in Compose.

## Setup

Set up your app to let you test compose code.

First, add the following dependencies to the `build.gradle` file of the module
containing your UI tests:

    // Test rules and transitive dependencies:
    androidTestImplementation("androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-junit4:$compose_version")
    // Needed for createComposeRule(), but not for createAndroidComposeRule<YourActivity>():
    debugImplementation("androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-manifest:$compose_version")

This module includes a [`ComposeTestRule`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/test/junit4/ComposeTestRule) and an implementation for Android
called [`AndroidComposeTestRule`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/test/junit4/AndroidComposeTestRule). Through this rule you can set Compose
content or access the activity. You construct the rules using factory functions,
either [`createComposeRule`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/test/junit4/package-summary#createComposeRule()) or, if you need access to an activity,
[`createAndroidComposeRule`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/test/junit4/package-summary#createAndroidComposeRule()). A typical UI test for Compose looks like this:

    // file: app/src/androidTest/java/com/package/MyComposeTest.kt

    class MyComposeTest {

        @get:Rule val composeTestRule = createComposeRule()
        // use createAndroidComposeRule<YourActivity>() if you need access to
        // an activity

        @Test
        fun myTest() {
            // Start the app
            composeTestRule.setContent {
                MyAppTheme {
                    MainScreen(uiState = fakeUiState, /*...*/)
                }
            }

            composeTestRule.onNodeWithText("Continue").performClick()

            composeTestRule.onNodeWithText("Welcome").assertIsDisplayed()
        }
    }
