User interface components give feedback to the device user by the way they
respond to user interactions. Every component has its own way of responding to
interactions, which helps the user know what their interactions are doing. For
example, if a user touches a button on a device's touchscreen, the button is
likely to change in some way, perhaps by adding a highlight color. This change
lets the user know that they touched the button. If the user didn't want to do
that, they'll know to drag their finger away from the button before
releasing--otherwise, the button will activate.

The Compose
[Gestures](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/pointer-input/understand-gestures)
documentation covers how
Compose components handle low-level pointer event, such as pointer moves and
clicks. Out of the box, Compose abstracts those low-level events into
higher-level interactions--for example, a series of pointer events might add up
to a button press-and-release. Understanding those higher-level abstractions can
help you customize how your UI responds to the user. For example, you might want
to customize how a component's appearance changes when the user interacts with
it, or maybe you just want to maintain a log of those user actions. This
document gives you the information you need to modify the standard UI elements,
or design your own.

## Interactions

In many cases, you don't need to know just how your Compose component is
interpreting user interactions. For example, `Button` relies on
[`Modifier.clickable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).clickable(kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.String,androidx.compose.ui.semantics.Role,kotlin.Function0))
to figure out whether the user clicked the button. If you're adding a typical
button to your app, you can define the button's `onClick` code, and
`Modifier.clickable` runs that code when appropriate. That means you don't need
to know whether the user tapped the screen or selected the button with a
keyboard; `Modifier.clickable` figures out that the user performed a click, and
responds by running your `onClick` code.

However, if you want to customize your UI component's response to user behavior,
you may need to know more of what's going on under the hood. This section gives
you some of that information.

When a user interacts with a UI component, the system represents their behavior
by generating a number of
[`Interaction`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/Interaction)
events. For example, if a user touches a button, the button generates
[`PressInteraction.Press`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/PressInteraction.Press).
If the user lifts their finger inside the button, it generates a
[`PressInteraction.Release`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/PressInteraction.Release),
letting the button know that the click was finished. On the other hand, if the
user drags their finger outside the button, then lifts their finger, the button
generates
[`PressInteraction.Cancel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/PressInteraction.Cancel),
to indicate that the press on the button was canceled, not completed.

These interactions are **unopinionated**. That is, these low-level interaction
events don't intend to interpret the meaning of the user actions, or their
sequence. They also don't interpret which user actions might take priority over
other actions.

These interactions generally come in pairs, with a start and an end. The second
interaction contains a reference to the first one. For example, if a user
touches a button then lifts their finger, the touch generates a
[`PressInteraction.Press`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/PressInteraction.Press)
interaction, and the release generates a
[`PressInteraction.Release`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/PressInteraction.Release);
the `Release` has a `press` property identifying the initial
`PressInteraction.Press`.

You can see the interactions for a particular component by observing its
`InteractionSource`. `InteractionSource` is built on top of [Kotlin
flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow), so you can collect the interactions from it the same way
you'd work with any other flow. For more information about this design decision,
see the [Illuminating Interactions](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/illuminating-interactions-visual-state-in-jetpack-compose-188fa041b791) blog post.

## Interaction state

You might want to extend the built-in functionality of your components by also
tracking the interactions yourself. For example, perhaps you want a button to
change color when it's pressed. The simplest way to track the interactions is to
observe the appropriate interaction *state* . `InteractionSource` offers a number
of methods that reveal various interaction statuses as state. For example, if
you want to see whether a particular button is pressed, you can call its
[`InteractionSource.collectIsPressedAsState()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/interaction/InteractionSource#(androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.InteractionSource).collectIsPressedAsState())
method:


```kotlin
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
val isPressed by interactionSource.collectIsPressedAsState()

Button(
    onClick = { /* do something */ },
    interactionSource = interactionSource
) {
    Text(if (isPressed) "Pressed!" else "Not pressed")
}
```

<br />

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `InteractionSource` provides a read-only flow of the interactions, while `MutableInteractionSource` lets you add new interactions into the flow. When you build your own components, it's a best practice to use and expose a `MutableInteractionSource`, even if you don't currently plan on adding interactions yourself.

Besides `collectIsPressedAsState()`, Compose also provides
`collectIsFocusedAsState()`, `collectIsDraggedAsState()`, and
`collectIsHoveredAsState()`. These methods are actually convenience methods
built on top of lower-level `InteractionSource` APIs. In some cases, you may
want to use those lower-level functions directly.

For example, suppose you need to know whether a button is being pressed, and
*also* whether it's being dragged. If you use both `collectIsPressedAsState()`
and `collectIsDraggedAsState()`, Compose does a lot of duplicate work, and
there's no guarantee you'll get all the interactions in the right order. For
situations like this, you might want to work directly with the
`InteractionSource`. For more information about tracking the interactions
yourself with `InteractionSource`, see [Work with `InteractionSource`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/user-interactions/handling-interactions#work-with-interactionsource).

The following section describes how to consume and emit interactions with
`InteractionSource` and `MutableInteractionSource`, respectively.

## Consume and emit `Interaction`

`InteractionSource` represents a read-only stream of `Interactions` --- it is not
possible to emit an `Interaction` to an `InteractionSource`. To emit
`Interaction`s, you need to use a `MutableInteractionSource`, which extends from
`InteractionSource`.

Modifiers and components can consume, emit, or consume and emit `Interactions`.
The following sections describe how to consume and emit interactions from both
modifiers and components.

### Consuming modifier example

For a modifier that draws a border for focused state, you only need to observe
`Interactions`, so you can accept an `InteractionSource`:


```kotlin
fun Modifier.focusBorder(interactionSource: InteractionSource): Modifier {
    // ...
}
```

<br />

It is clear from the function signature that this modifier is a *consumer* --- it
can consume `Interaction`s, but cannot emit them.

### Producing modifier example

For a modifier that handles hover events like [`Modifier.hoverable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).hoverable(androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.MutableInteractionSource,kotlin.Boolean)), you
need to emit `Interactions`, and accept a `MutableInteractionSource` as a
parameter instead:


```kotlin
fun Modifier.hover(interactionSource: MutableInteractionSource, enabled: Boolean): Modifier {
    // ...
}
```

<br />

This modifier is a *producer* --- it can use the provided
`MutableInteractionSource` to emit `HoverInteractions` when it is hovered or
unhovered.

### Build components that consume and produce

High-level components such as a Material `Button` act as both producers and
consumers. They handle input and focus events, and also change their appearance
in response to these events, such as showing a ripple or animating their
elevation. As a result, they directly expose `MutableInteractionSource` as a
parameter, so that you can provide your own remembered instance:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun Button(
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    enabled: Boolean = true,

    // exposes MutableInteractionSource as a parameter
    interactionSource: MutableInteractionSource? = null,

    elevation: ButtonElevation? = ButtonDefaults.elevatedButtonElevation(),
    shape: Shape = MaterialTheme.shapes.small,
    border: BorderStroke? = null,
    colors: ButtonColors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors(),
    contentPadding: PaddingValues = ButtonDefaults.ContentPadding,
    content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit
) { /* content() */ }
```

<br />

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If null is provided, interactions will still happen internally---this just controls whether you are hoisting the interaction source out of the component. A `MutableInteractionSource` will still be created internally, if needed.

This allows [hoisting](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state#state-hoisting) the
`MutableInteractionSource` out of the component and observing all the
`Interaction`s produced by the component. You can use this to control the
appearance of that component, or any other component in your UI.

**If you are building your own interactive high level components, we recommend
that you expose `MutableInteractionSource` as a parameter in this way**. Besides
following state hoisting best practices, this also makes it easy to read and
control the visual state of a component in the same way that any other sort of
state (such as enabled state) can be read and controlled.

Compose follows a [layered architectural approach](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layering),
so high-level Material components are built on top of foundational building
blocks that produce the `Interaction`s they need to control ripples and other
visual effects. The foundation library provides high-level interaction modifiers
such as [`Modifier.hoverable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).hoverable(androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.MutableInteractionSource,kotlin.Boolean)), [`Modifier.focusable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).focusable(kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.MutableInteractionSource)), and
[`Modifier.draggable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/gestures/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).draggable(androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.DraggableState,androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.Orientation,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.MutableInteractionSource,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.coroutines.SuspendFunction2,kotlin.coroutines.SuspendFunction2,kotlin.Boolean)).

To build a component that responds to hover events, you can simply use
`Modifier.hoverable` and pass a `MutableInteractionSource` as a parameter.
Whenever the component is hovered, it emits `HoverInteraction`s, and you can use
this to change how the component appears.


```kotlin
// This InteractionSource will emit hover interactions
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }

Box(
    Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .hoverable(interactionSource = interactionSource),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
    Text("Hello!")
}
```

<br />

To also make this component focusable, you can add `Modifier.focusable` and pass
the *same* `MutableInteractionSource` as a parameter. Now, both
`HoverInteraction.Enter/Exit` and `FocusInteraction.Focus/Unfocus` are emitted
through the same `MutableInteractionSource`, and you can customize the
appearance for both types of interaction in the same place:


```kotlin
// This InteractionSource will emit hover and focus interactions
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }

Box(
    Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .hoverable(interactionSource = interactionSource)
        .focusable(interactionSource = interactionSource),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
    Text("Hello!")
}
```

<br />

[`Modifier.clickable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).clickable(kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.String,androidx.compose.ui.semantics.Role,kotlin.Function0)) is an even higher
level abstraction than `hoverable` and `focusable` --- for a component to be
clickable, it is implicitly hoverable, and components that can be clicked should
also be focusable. You can use `Modifier.clickable` to create a component that
handles hover, focus, and press interactions, without needing to combine lower
level APIs. If you want to make your component clickable as well, you can
replace `hoverable` and `focusable` with a `clickable`:


```kotlin
// This InteractionSource will emit hover, focus, and press interactions
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
Box(
    Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .clickable(
            onClick = {},
            interactionSource = interactionSource,

            // Also show a ripple effect
            indication = ripple()
        ),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
) {
    Text("Hello!")
}
```

<br />

## Work with `InteractionSource`

If you need low-level information about interactions with a component, you can
use standard [flow APIs](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) for that component's `InteractionSource`.
For example, suppose you want to maintain a list of the press and drag
interactions for an `InteractionSource`. This code does half the job, adding
the new presses to the list as they come in:


```kotlin
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
val interactions = remember { mutableStateListOf<Interaction>() }

LaunchedEffect(interactionSource) {
    interactionSource.interactions.collect { interaction ->
        when (interaction) {
            is PressInteraction.Press -> {
                interactions.add(interaction)
            }
            is DragInteraction.Start -> {
                interactions.add(interaction)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

But besides adding the new interactions, you also have to remove interactions
when they end (for example, when the user lifts their finger back off the
component). That's easy to do, since the end interactions always carry a
reference to the associated start interaction. This code shows how you'd remove
the interactions that have ended:


```kotlin
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
val interactions = remember { mutableStateListOf<Interaction>() }

LaunchedEffect(interactionSource) {
    interactionSource.interactions.collect { interaction ->
        when (interaction) {
            is PressInteraction.Press -> {
                interactions.add(interaction)
            }
            is PressInteraction.Release -> {
                interactions.remove(interaction.press)
            }
            is PressInteraction.Cancel -> {
                interactions.remove(interaction.press)
            }
            is DragInteraction.Start -> {
                interactions.add(interaction)
            }
            is DragInteraction.Stop -> {
                interactions.remove(interaction.start)
            }
            is DragInteraction.Cancel -> {
                interactions.remove(interaction.start)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

Now, if you want to know if the component is currently being pressed or dragged,
all you have to do is check whether `interactions` is empty:


```kotlin
val isPressedOrDragged = interactions.isNotEmpty()
```

<br />

If you want to know what the most recent interaction was, just look at the last
item in the list. For example, this is how the Compose ripple implementation
figures out the appropriate state overlay to use for the most recent interaction:


```kotlin
val lastInteraction = when (interactions.lastOrNull()) {
    is DragInteraction.Start -> "Dragged"
    is PressInteraction.Press -> "Pressed"
    else -> "No state"
}
```

<br />

Because all `Interaction`s follow the same structure, there is not much of a
difference in code when working with different types of user interactions --- the
overall pattern is the same.

Note that the previous examples in this section represent the `Flow` of
interactions using [`State`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/State)
--- this makes it easy to observe updated values,
as reading the state value will automatically cause recompositions. However,
composition is *batched* pre-frame. This means that if the state changes, and
then changes back within the same frame, components observing the state won't
see the change.

This is important for interactions, as interactions can regularly start and end
within the same frame. For example, using the previous example with `Button`:


```kotlin
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
val isPressed by interactionSource.collectIsPressedAsState()

Button(onClick = { /* do something */ }, interactionSource = interactionSource) {
    Text(if (isPressed) "Pressed!" else "Not pressed")
}
```

<br />

If a press starts and ends within the same frame, the text will never display as
"Pressed!". In most cases, this is not an issue --- showing a visual effect for
such a small amount of time will result in flickering, and won't be very
noticeable to the user. For some cases, such as showing a ripple effect or a
similar animation, you may want to show the effect for at least a minimum amount
of time, instead of immediately stopping if the button is no longer pressed. To
do this, you can directly start and stop animations from inside the collect
lambda, instead of writing to a state. There is an example of this pattern in
the [Build an advanced `Indication` with animated border](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/user-interactions/handling-interactions#build-advanced) section.

## Example: Build component with custom interaction handling

To see how you can build components with a custom response to input, here's an
example of a modified button. In this case, suppose you want a button that
responds to presses by changing its appearance:
![Animation of a button that dynamically adds a grocery cart icon when clicked](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/handling-interactions-iconbutton.gif) **Figure 3.** A button that dynamically adds an icon when clicked.

To do this, build a custom composable based on `Button`, and have it take an
additional `icon` parameter to draw the icon (in this case, a shopping cart). You
call `collectIsPressedAsState()` to track whether the user is hovering over the
button; when they are, you add the icon. Here's what the code looks like:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun PressIconButton(
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    icon: @Composable () -> Unit,
    text: @Composable () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    interactionSource: MutableInteractionSource? = null
) {
    val isPressed = interactionSource?.collectIsPressedAsState()?.value ?: false

    Button(
        onClick = onClick,
        modifier = modifier,
        interactionSource = interactionSource
    ) {
        AnimatedVisibility(visible = isPressed) {
            if (isPressed) {
                Row {
                    icon()
                    Spacer(Modifier.size(ButtonDefaults.IconSpacing))
                }
            }
        }
        text()
    }
}
```

<br />

And here's what it looks like to use that new composable:


```kotlin
PressIconButton(
    onClick = {},
    icon = { Icon(Icons.Filled.ShoppingCart, contentDescription = null) },
    text = { Text("Add to cart") }
)
```

<br />

Because this new `PressIconButton` is built on top of the existing Material
`Button`, it reacts to user interactions in all the usual ways. When the user
presses the button, it changes its opacity slightly, just like an ordinary
Material `Button`.

## Create and apply a reusable custom effect with `Indication`

In previous sections, you learned how to change part of a component in response
to different `Interaction`s, such as showing an icon when pressed. This same
approach can be used for changing the value of parameters you provide to a
component, or changing the content displayed inside a component, but this is
only applicable on a per-component basis. Often, an application or design system
will have a generic system for stateful visual effects --- an effect that should
be applied to all components in a consistent manner.

If you are building this kind of design system, customizing one component and
reusing this customization for other components can be difficult for the
following reasons:

- Every component in the design system needs the same boilerplate
- It's easy to forget to apply this effect to newly built components and custom clickable components
- It may be difficult to combine the custom effect with other effects

To avoid these issues and easily scale a custom component across your system,
you can use [`Indication`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/Indication).
`Indication` represents a reusable visual effect that can be applied across
components in an application or design system. `Indication` is split into two
parts:

- `IndicationNodeFactory`: A factory that creates [`Modifier.Node`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/Modifier.Node) instances that
  render visual effects for a component. For simpler implementations that do not
  change across components, this can be a singleton (object) and reused across
  the entire application.

  These instances can be stateful or stateless. Since they are created per
  component, they can retrieve values from a `CompositionLocal` to change how
  they appear or behave inside a particular component, as with any other
  `Modifier.Node`.
- [`Modifier.indication`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier).indication(androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.InteractionSource,androidx.compose.foundation.Indication)):
  A modifier that draws `Indication` for a
  component. `Modifier.clickable` and other high level interaction modifiers
  accept an indication parameter directly, so they not only emit
  `Interaction`s, but can also draw visual effects for the `Interaction`s they
  emit. So, for simple cases, you can just use `Modifier.clickable` without
  needing `Modifier.indication`.

### Replace effect with an `Indication`

This section describes how to replace a manual scale effect applied to one
specific button with an indication equivalent that can be reused across multiple
components.

The following code creates a button that scales downwards on press:


```kotlin
val interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
val isPressed by interactionSource.collectIsPressedAsState()
val scale by animateFloatAsState(targetValue = if (isPressed) 0.9f else 1f, label = "scale")

Button(
    modifier = Modifier.scale(scale),
    onClick = { },
    interactionSource = interactionSource
) {
    Text(if (isPressed) "Pressed!" else "Not pressed")
}
```

<br />

To convert the scale effect in the snippet above to an `Indication`, follow
these steps:

1. **Create the [`Modifier.Node`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/custom-modifiers#modifiernode) responsible for applying the scale effect**.
   When attached, the node observes the interaction source, similar to previous
   examples. The only difference here is that it directly launches animations
   instead of converting the incoming Interactions to state.

   The node needs to implement [`DrawModifierNode`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/node/DrawModifierNode) so it can override
   `ContentDrawScope#draw()`, and render a scale effect using the same drawing
   commands as with any other graphics API in Compose.

   Calling `drawContent()` available from the `ContentDrawScope` receiver will draw
   the actual component that the `Indication` should be applied to, so you just
   need to call this function within a scale transformation. Make sure your
   `Indication` implementations always call `drawContent()` at some point;
   otherwise, the component you are applying the `Indication` to will not be drawn.

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Note:** The `IndicationInstance` may be lazily created in cases when there is an incoming interaction.


   ```kotlin
   private class ScaleNode(private val interactionSource: InteractionSource) :
       Modifier.Node(), DrawModifierNode {

       var currentPressPosition: Offset = Offset.Zero
       val animatedScalePercent = Animatable(1f)

       private suspend fun animateToPressed(pressPosition: Offset) {
           currentPressPosition = pressPosition
           animatedScalePercent.animateTo(0.9f, spring())
       }

       private suspend fun animateToResting() {
           animatedScalePercent.animateTo(1f, spring())
       }

       override fun onAttach() {
           coroutineScope.launch {
               interactionSource.interactions.collectLatest { interaction ->
                   when (interaction) {
                       is PressInteraction.Press -> animateToPressed(interaction.pressPosition)
                       is PressInteraction.Release -> animateToResting()
                       is PressInteraction.Cancel -> animateToResting()
                   }
               }
           }
       }

       override fun ContentDrawScope.draw() {
           scale(
               scale = animatedScalePercent.value,
               pivot = currentPressPosition
           ) {
               this@draw.drawContent()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   <br />

2. **Create the `IndicationNodeFactory`**. Its only responsibility is to create a
   new node instance for a provided interaction source. As there are no
   parameters to configure the indication, the factory can be an object:


   ```kotlin
   object ScaleIndication : IndicationNodeFactory {
       override fun create(interactionSource: InteractionSource): DelegatableNode {
           return ScaleNode(interactionSource)
       }

       override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean = other === ScaleIndication
       override fun hashCode() = 100
   }
   ```

   <br />

3. `Modifier.clickable` uses `Modifier.indication` internally, so to make a
   clickable component with `ScaleIndication`, all you need to do is **provide the
   `Indication` as a parameter to `clickable`**:


   ```kotlin
   Box(
       modifier = Modifier
           .size(100.dp)
           .clickable(
               onClick = {},
               indication = ScaleIndication,
               interactionSource = null
           )
           .background(Color.Blue),
       contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
   ) {
       Text("Hello!", color = Color.White)
   }
   ```

   <br />

   This also makes it easy to build high level, reusable components using a custom
   `Indication` --- a button could look like:


   ```kotlin
   @Composable
   fun ScaleButton(
       onClick: () -> Unit,
       modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
       enabled: Boolean = true,
       interactionSource: MutableInteractionSource? = null,
       shape: Shape = CircleShape,
       content: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit
   ) {
       Row(
           modifier = modifier
               .defaultMinSize(minWidth = 76.dp, minHeight = 48.dp)
               .clickable(
                   enabled = enabled,
                   indication = ScaleIndication,
                   interactionSource = interactionSource,
                   onClick = onClick
               )
               .border(width = 2.dp, color = Color.Blue, shape = shape)
               .padding(horizontal = 16.dp, vertical = 8.dp),
           horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
           verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically,
           content = content
       )
   }
   ```

   <br />

You can then use the button in the following way:


```kotlin
ScaleButton(onClick = {}) {
    Icon(Icons.Filled.ShoppingCart, "")
    Spacer(Modifier.padding(10.dp))
    Text(text = "Add to cart!")
}
```

<br />

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Ripples are drawn on the `RenderThread` (using the framework `RippleDrawable` under the hood), which means that they can continue to animate smoothly while the UI thread is busy, such as when pressing a button causes your app to navigate to a new screen. There are no public APIs to allow drawing to the `RenderThread` manually, so if you are trying to build an `Indication` that can still have an animation after a click has finished (such as a ripple, or the example in the next section), be aware that this can cause jank if the click causes a lot of work to happen on the UI thread.

### Build an advanced `Indication` with animated border

`Indication` is not just limited to transformation effects, such as scaling a
component. Because `IndicationNodeFactory` returns a `Modifier.Node`, you can draw
any kind of effect above or below the content as with other drawing APIs. For
example, you can draw an animated border around the component and an overlay on
top of the component when it is pressed:
![A button with a fancy rainbow effect on press](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/compose/images/touchinput/rainbow-effect.gif) **Figure 5.** An animated border effect drawn with `Indication`.

The `Indication` implementation here is very similar to the previous example ---
it just creates a node with some parameters. Since the animated border depends
on the shape and the border of the component the `Indication` is used for, the
`Indication` implementation also requires shape and border width to be provided
as parameters:


```kotlin
data class NeonIndication(private val shape: Shape, private val borderWidth: Dp) : IndicationNodeFactory {

    override fun create(interactionSource: InteractionSource): DelegatableNode {
        return NeonNode(
            shape,
            // Double the border size for a stronger press effect
            borderWidth * 2,
            interactionSource
        )
    }
}
```

<br />

The `Modifier.Node` implementation is also conceptually the same, even if the
drawing code is more complicated. As before, it observes `InteractionSource`
when attached, launches animations, and implements `DrawModifierNode` to draw
the effect on top of the content:


```kotlin
private class NeonNode(
    private val shape: Shape,
    private val borderWidth: Dp,
    private val interactionSource: InteractionSource
) : Modifier.Node(), DrawModifierNode {
    var currentPressPosition: Offset = Offset.Zero
    val animatedProgress = Animatable(0f)
    val animatedPressAlpha = Animatable(1f)

    var pressedAnimation: Job? = null
    var restingAnimation: Job? = null

    private suspend fun animateToPressed(pressPosition: Offset) {
        // Finish any existing animations, in case of a new press while we are still showing
        // an animation for a previous one
        restingAnimation?.cancel()
        pressedAnimation?.cancel()
        pressedAnimation = coroutineScope.launch {
            currentPressPosition = pressPosition
            animatedPressAlpha.snapTo(1f)
            animatedProgress.snapTo(0f)
            animatedProgress.animateTo(1f, tween(450))
        }
    }

    private fun animateToResting() {
        restingAnimation = coroutineScope.launch {
            // Wait for the existing press animation to finish if it is still ongoing
            pressedAnimation?.join()
            animatedPressAlpha.animateTo(0f, tween(250))
            animatedProgress.snapTo(0f)
        }
    }

    override fun onAttach() {
        coroutineScope.launch {
            interactionSource.interactions.collect { interaction ->
                when (interaction) {
                    is PressInteraction.Press -> animateToPressed(interaction.pressPosition)
                    is PressInteraction.Release -> animateToResting()
                    is PressInteraction.Cancel -> animateToResting()
                }
            }
        }
    }

    override fun ContentDrawScope.draw() {
        val (startPosition, endPosition) = calculateGradientStartAndEndFromPressPosition(
            currentPressPosition, size
        )

            endPosition = endPosition,
            progress = animatedProgress.value
        )
        val alpha = animatedPressAlpha.value

        drawContent()

        val outline = shape.createOutline(size, layoutDirection, this)
        // Draw overlay on top of content
        drawOutline(
            outline = outline,
            brush = brush,
            alpha = alpha * 0.1f
        )

The main difference here is that there is now a minimum duration for the
animation with the `animateToResting()` function, so even if the press is
immediately released, the press animation will continue. There is also handling
for multiple quick presses at the start of `animateToPressed` --- if a press
happens during an existing press or resting animation, the previous animation is
canceled, and the press animation starts from the beginning. To support multiple
concurrent effects (such as with ripples, where a new ripple animation will draw
on top of other ripples), you can track the animations in a list, instead of
canceling existing animations and starting new ones.
