App widgets are miniature app views that you can embed in other apps---such
as the home screen---and receive periodic updates. These views are referred
to as *widgets* in the user interface, and you can publish one with an app
widget provider (or *widget provider* ). An app component that holds other
widgets is called an app widget host (or *widget host*). Figure 1 shows a sample
music widget:
![Example of music widget](https://developer.android.com/static/images/appwidgets/music.png) **Figure 1.** Example of a music widget.

This document describes how to publish a widget using a widget provider. For
details about creating your own [`AppWidgetHost`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetHost) to host
app widgets, see [Build a widget host](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/host).

For information about how to design your widget, see [App widgets overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/overview).

## Widget components

To create a widget, you need the following basic components:

[`AppWidgetProviderInfo`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProviderInfo) object
:   Describes the metadata for a widget, such
    as the widget's layout, update frequency, and [`AppWidgetProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProvider) class. `AppWidgetProviderInfo` is [defined in
    XML](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/appwidgets#AppWidgetProviderInfo), as described in this document.

[`AppWidgetProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/appwidget/AppWidgetProvider) class
:   Defines the basic methods
    that let you programmatically interface with the widget. Through it, you
    receive broadcasts when the widget is updated, enabled, disabled, or
    deleted. You [declare `AppWidgetProvider` in the manifest](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/appwidgets#Manifest) and then
    [implement](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/appwidgets#AppWidgetProvider) it, as described in this document.

View layout
:   Defines the initial layout for the widget. The layout is [defined
    in XML](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/appwidgets#layout), as described in this document.

Figure 2 shows how these components fit into the overall app widget processing
flow.
![App widget processing flow](https://developer.android.com/static/images/appwidgets/flow-diagram.png) **Figure 2.** App widget processing flow.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Android Studio can automatically create a set of `AppWidgetProviderInfo`, `AppWidgetProvider`, and view layout files. Choose **New \> Widget \> App Widget**.

If your widget needs user configuration, implement the app widget configuration
activity. This activity lets users modify widget settings---for example, the
time zone for a clock widget.

- Starting in Android 12 (API level 31), you can provide a default configuration and let users reconfigure the widget later. See [Use the
  widget's default configuration](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/configuration#use-default) and [Enable users to reconfigure placed
  widgets](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/configuration#reconfigure-widgets) for more details.
- In Android 11 (API level 30) or lower, this activity is launched every time the user adds the widget to their home screen.

We also recommend the following improvements: [flexible widget layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/layouts), [miscellaneous enhancements](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/enhance), [advanced widgets](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/advanced), [collection widgets](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/collections), and [building a widget host](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/host).

## Declare the AppWidgetProviderInfo XML

Defining the metadata settings (such as default cell sizes, resize constraints,
and update frequencies) is exactly identical across both traditional Views and
Glance-based widgets.

To learn how to define and configure your metadata XML file, see the
Compose-first [Declare the AppWidgetProviderInfo XML section](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/glance/create-app-widget#AppWidgetProviderInfo) in the Glance
documentation.

## Use the AppWidgetProvider class to handle widget broadcasts

The platform's broadcast receiver mechanics, manifest declaration filters, and
lifecycle event loops are unified underneath the platform. In Compose-first
development, these broadcasts are orchestrated using the
`GlanceAppWidgetReceiver` wrapper.

To understand how to register your receiver in the manifest and implement
Hilt-compatible lifecycle overrides, see the Compose-first [Use the
AppWidgetProvider class to handle broadcasts section](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/glance/create-app-widget#widget-broadcasts) in the Glance
documentation.

## Create the widget layout

You must define an initial layout for your widget in XML and save it in the
project's `res/layout/` directory. Refer to [Design guidelines](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/overview#design) for details.

Creating the widget layout is straightforward if you're familiar with
[layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout). However, be aware that widget layouts are based on
[`RemoteViews`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RemoteViews), which doesn't support every kind of layout or view widget.
You can't use custom views or subclasses of the views that are supported by
`RemoteViews`.

`RemoteViews` also supports [`ViewStub`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewStub), which is an invisible, zero-sized
`View` you can use to lazily inflate layout resources at runtime.

### Support for stateful behavior

Android 12 adds support for stateful behavior using the following
existing components:

- [`CheckBox`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/widget/CheckBox)

- [`Switch`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Switch)

- [`RadioButton`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RadioButton)

The widget is still stateless. Your app must store the state and register for
state change events.
![Example of shopping list widget showing stateful behavior](https://developer.android.com/static/images/appwidgets/home.png) **Figure 3.** Example of stateful behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Always explicitly set the current checked state using `RemoteViews.setCompoundButtonChecked`, or you might encounter unexpected results when your widget is dragged or resized.

The following code example shows how to implement these components.

### Kotlin

    // Check the view.
    remoteView.setCompoundButtonChecked(R.id.my_checkbox, true)

    // Check a radio group.
    remoteView.setRadioGroupChecked(R.id.my_radio_group, R.id.radio_button_2)

    // Listen for check changes. The intent has an extra with the key
    // EXTRA_CHECKED that specifies the current checked state of the view.
    remoteView.setOnCheckedChangeResponse(
            R.id.my_checkbox,
            RemoteViews.RemoteResponse.fromPendingIntent(onCheckedChangePendingIntent)
    )

### Java

    // Check the view.
    remoteView.setCompoundButtonChecked(R.id.my_checkbox, true);

    // Check a radio group.
    remoteView.setRadioGroupChecked(R.id.my_radio_group, R.id.radio_button_2);

    // Listen for check changes. The intent has an extra with the key
    // EXTRA_CHECKED that specifies the current checked state of the view.
    remoteView.setOnCheckedChangeResponse(
        R.id.my_checkbox,
        RemoteViews.RemoteResponse.fromPendingIntent(onCheckedChangePendingIntent));

Provide two layouts: one targeting devices running Android 12 or
higher in `res/layout-v31`, and the other targeting previous
Android 11 or lower in the default `res/layout` folder.

## Implement rounded corners

Calculating the outer background and inner proportional radii is standard and
shared. In Compose-first development, this can be set dynamically in Kotlin
alongside custom theme resources.

To implement corner radii or set up dynamic styles for older Android devices,
see the Compose-first [Implement rounded corners section](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/glance/create-app-widget#rounded-corner) in the Glance
documentation.
