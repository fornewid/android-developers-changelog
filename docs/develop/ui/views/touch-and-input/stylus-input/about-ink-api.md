The [`Ink API`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/ink) helps you
add beautiful, low-latency freehand drawing to your Android app. Ink API
simplifies the complexities of input handling and graphics rendering, allowing
you to quickly implement responsive drawing surfaces for styluses and other
pointer inputs.

The API uses the
[Jetpack Graphics Library for low latency](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/graphics) to help
provide the smoothest and most responsive inking experience possible.
