If your app plays back audio and video, you must add UI components for
displaying media and controlling playback.

AndroidX Media3 offers a
[`PlayerView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media3/ui/PlayerView) that displays playback
controls, video, subtitles, and album art during playback. To make it work
properly, connect `PlayerView` to a
[`Player`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media3/common/Player) instance such as
[`ExoPlayer`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media3/exoplayer/ExoPlayer).
