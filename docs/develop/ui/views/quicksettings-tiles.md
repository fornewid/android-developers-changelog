Quick Settings are tiles displayed in the [Quick Settings panel](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9083864),
representing actions, that users can tap to quickly complete recurring tasks.
Your app can provide a custom tile to users through the [`TileService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService)
class, and use a [`Tile`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile) object to track the state of the tile. For example,
you could create a tile that lets users turn a VPN provided by your app on or
off.
![Quick Settings panel with the VPN tile turned
on and off](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/views/images/quick-settings-vpn-on-off.png) **Figure 1.** Quick Settings panel with the VPN tile turned on and off.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** This guide only discusses non-Wear tiles --- Quick Settings tiles have no relation to the tiles defined within Wear OS. For Wear OS tiles, see the [WearOS Tiles Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/tiles).

## Decide when to create a tile

We recommend creating tiles for specific functionalities that you expect users
to either access often or need fast access to (or both). The most effective
tiles are the ones that match both of these qualities, providing quick access to
frequently-performed actions.

For example, you could create a tile for a fitness app that would allow users to
quickly start a workout session. However, we wouldn't recommend creating a tile
for the same app that would allow users to review their entire workout history.
![Fitness app tile use cases](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/views/images/use-cases-fitness-tiles.png) **Figure 2.** Examples of recommended versus non-recommended tiles for a fitness app.

To help improve your tile's discoverability and ease of use, we recommend
avoiding certain practices:

- Avoid using tiles to launch an app. Use an [app shortcut](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts) or a standard
  launcher instead.

- Avoid using tiles for one-time user actions. Use an app shortcut or a
  [notification](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications) instead.

- Avoid creating too many tiles. We recommend a maximum of two per app. Use an
  app shortcut instead.

- Avoid using tiles that display information, but aren't interactive for
  users. Use a notification or a [widget](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/overview) instead.

## Create your tile

To create a tile, you need to first create an appropriate tile icon, then
create and declare your `TileService` in your app's manifest file.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Creating a `TileService` for your app does not add it to the user's Quick Settings panel. Your `TileService` acts as an interface with the tile only after the user has added it.

The [Quick Settings sample](https://github.com/android/platform-samples/tree/main/samples/user-interface/quicksettings) provides an example of how to create
and manage a tile.

### Create your custom icon

You'll need to supply a custom icon, which displays on the tile in the Quick
Settings panel. (You'll add this icon when declaring the `TileService`,
described in the next section.) The icon must be a solid white with a
transparent background, measure 24 x 24dp, and be in the form of a
[`VectorDrawable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/VectorDrawable).
![Example of a vector drawable](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/views/images/vector-drawable.png) **Figure 3.** Example of a vector drawable.

Create an icon that visually hints at the purpose of your tile. This helps users
easily identify if your tile fits their needs. For example, you might create an
icon of a stopwatch for a tile for a fitness app that allows users to start a
workout session.

### Create and declare your TileService

Create a service for your tile that extends the `TileService` class.

### Kotlin

```kotlin
class MyQSTileService: TileService() {

  // Called when the user adds your tile.
  override fun onTileAdded() {
    super.onTileAdded()
  }
  // Called when your app can update your tile.
  override fun onStartListening() {
    super.onStartListening()
  }

  // Called when your app can no longer update your tile.
  override fun onStopListening() {
    super.onStopListening()
  }

  // Called when the user taps on your tile in an active or inactive state.
  override fun onClick() {
    super.onClick()
  }
  // Called when the user removes your tile.
  override fun onTileRemoved() {
    super.onTileRemoved()
  }
}
```

### Java

```java
public class MyQSTileService extends TileService {

  // Called when the user adds your tile.
  @Override
  public void onTileAdded() {
    super.onTileAdded();
  }

  // Called when your app can update your tile.
  @Override
  public void onStartListening() {
    super.onStartListening();
  }

  // Called when your app can no longer update your tile.
  @Override
  public void onStopListening() {
    super.onStopListening();
  }

  // Called when the user taps on your tile in an active or inactive state.
  @Override
  public void onClick() {
    super.onClick();
  }

  // Called when the user removes your tile.
  @Override
  public void onTileRemoved() {
    super.onTileRemoved();
  }
}
```

Declare your `TileService` in your app's manifest file. Add the name and label
of your `TileService`, the custom icon you created in the preceding section,
and the appropriate permission.

     <service
         android:name=".MyQSTileService"
         android:exported="true"
         android:label="@string/my_default_tile_label"  // 18-character limit.
         android:icon="@drawable/my_default_icon_label"
         android:permission="android.permission.BIND_QUICK_SETTINGS_TILE">
         <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="android.service.quicksettings.action.QS_TILE" />
         </intent-filter>
     </service>

## Manage your TileService

Once you've created and declared your `TileService` in your app manifest, you
have to manage its state.

`TileService` is a [bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services). Your `TileService` is bound when
requested by your app or if the system needs to communicate with it. A typical
[bound-service lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services#Lifecycle) contains the following four callback methods:
[`onCreate()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#onCreate()), [`onBind()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#onBind(android.content.Intent)), [`onUnbind()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#onUnbind(android.content.Intent)), and
[`onDestroy()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#onDestroy()). These methods are invoked by the system each time the
service enters a new lifecycle phase.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** Your `TileService` will still go through the typical `Service` lifecycle. However, `TileService` differs from most other bound services because it contains `TileService`-specific lifecycle methods that your app must react to.

### TileService lifecycle overview

In addition to the callbacks that control the bound-service lifecycle, you must
implement other methods specific to the `TileService` lifecycle. These methods
may be called outside of `onCreate()` and `onDestroy()` because the `Service`
lifecycle methods and the `TileService` lifecycle methods are called in two
separate asynchronous threads.

The `TileService` lifecycle contains the following methods, which are invoked
by the system each time your `TileService` enters a new lifecycle phase:

- [`onTileAdded()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#onTileAdded()): This method is called only when the user adds your
  tile for the first time, and if the user removes and adds your tile again.
  This is the best time to do any one-time initialization. However, this may
  not satisfy all the needed initialization.

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Note:** `onTileAdded()` is not called whenever the tile is created. For example, `onTileAdded()` is not called when the device is rebooted or powered on if the tile had been added and not removed before the device was powered off.

- [`onStartListening()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#onStartListening()) and [`onStopListening()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#onStopListening()): These methods are
  called whenever your app updates the tile, and are called often. The
  `TileService` remains bound between `onStartListening()` and
  `onStopListening()`, allowing your app to modify the tile and push updates.

- [`onTileRemoved()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#onTileRemoved()): This method is called only if the user removes your
  tile.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution:** These phases may not occur consecutively. `onTileAdded()` may only be called once when your tile is added by a user to their Quick Settings panel. `onStartListening()` and `onStopListening()` may be called multiple times throughout the `TileService` lifecycle. `onTileRemoved()` will never be called if the user doesn't remove your tile from their Quick Settings panel.

### Select a listening mode

Your `TileService` listens in *active* mode or *non-active* mode. We recommend
using active mode, which you'll need to declare in the app manifest. Otherwise,
the `TileService` is the standard mode and doesn't need to be declared.

Do not assume your `TileService` will live outside of `onStartListening()` and
`onStopListening()` pair of methods.

#### Active mode (recommended)

Use active mode for a `TileService` that listens and monitors its state in its
own process. A `TileService` in active mode is bound for `onTileAdded()`,
`onTileRemoved()`, tap events, and when requested by the app process.

We recommend active mode if your `TileService` is notified when your tile state
should be updated by its own process. Active tiles limit the strain on the
system because they do not have to be bound every time the Quick Settings panel
becomes visible to the user.

The static [`TileService.requestListeningState()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#requestListeningState(android.content.Context,%20android.content.ComponentName)) method can be called to
request the start of the listening state and receive a callback to
`onStartListening()`.

You can declare active mode by adding the [`META_DATA_ACTIVE_TILE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#META_DATA_ACTIVE_TILE) to your
app's manifest file.

    <service ...>
        <meta-data android:name="android.service.quicksettings.ACTIVE_TILE"
             android:value="true" />
        ...
    </service>

#### Non-active mode

Non-active mode is the standard mode. A `TileService` is in non-active mode if
it is bound whenever your tile is visible to the user. This means that your
`TileService` may be created and bound again at times beyond its control. It
also may be unbound and destroyed when the user is not viewing the tile.

Your app receives a callback to `onStartListening()` after the user opens their
Quick Settings panel. You can update your `Tile` object as many times as you
want between `onStartListening()` and `onStopListening()`.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution:** If you use non-active mode instead of active mode, your `TileService` may be bound every time the user opens their Quick Settings panel.

You do not need to declare non-active mode---simply do not add the
`META_DATA_ACTIVE_TILE` to your app's manifest file.

### Tile states overview

After a user adds your tile, it always exists in one of the following states.

- [`STATE_ACTIVE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#STATE_ACTIVE): Indicates an on or enabled state. The user can
  interact with your tile while in this state.

  For example, for a fitness app tile that lets users initiate a timed workout
  session, `STATE_ACTIVE` would mean that the user has initiated a workout
  session and the timer is running.
- [`STATE_INACTIVE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#STATE_INACTIVE): Indicates an off or paused state. The user can
  interact with your tile while in this state.

  To use the fitness app tile example again, a tile in `STATE_INACTIVE` would
  mean that the user hasn't initiated a workout session, but could do so if
  they wanted to.
- [`STATE_UNAVAILABLE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#STATE_UNAVAILABLE): Indicates a temporarily unavailable state. The
  user cannot interact with your tile while in this state.

  For example, a tile in `STATE_UNAVAILABLE` means that the tile is not
  currently available to the user for some reason.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > **Caution:** Use `STATE_UNAVAILABLE` for tiles that are currently unavailable but could be put into an available state later. If the component will never be available for the user again, pass `COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED` into [`setComponentEnabledSetting()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/pm/PackageManager#setcomponentenabledsetting).

The system only sets the initial state of your `Tile` object. You set the `Tile`
object's state throughout the rest of its lifecycle.

The system may tint the tile icon and background to reflect the state of your
`Tile` object. `Tile` objects set to `STATE_ACTIVE` are the darkest, with
`STATE_INACTIVE` and `STATE_UNAVAILABLE` increasingly lighter. The exact hue
is specific to the manufacturer and version.
![VPN tile tinted to reflect object states](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/views/images/state-hues.png) **Figure 4.** Examples of a tile tinted to reflect the tile state (active, inactive, and unavailable states, respectively).

### Update your tile

You can update your tile once you receive a callback to `onStartListening()`.
Depending on the tile's mode, your tile can be updated at least once until
receiving a callback to `onStopListening()`.

In active mode, you can update your tile exactly once before receiving a
callback to `onStopListening()`. In non-active mode, you can update your tile as
many times as you want between `onStartListening()` and `onStopListening()`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Active mode lets you update your tile regardless of whether your tile is visible to the user or not.

You can retrieve your `Tile` object by calling [`getQsTile()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#getQsTile()). To update
specific fields of your `Tile` object, call the following methods:

- [`setContentDescription()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile#setContentDescription(java.lang.CharSequence))
- [`setIcon()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile#setIcon(java.lang.CharSequence))
- [`setLabel()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile#setLabel(java.lang.CharSequence))
- [`setState()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile#setState(int))
- [`setStateDescription()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile#setStateDescription(java.lang.CharSequence))
- [`setSubtitle()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/Tile#setSubtitle(java.lang.CharSequence))

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The icon and label set in your app's manifest file are the default values displayed on the tile in the Quick Settings panel. However, you can call the `setIcon()` and `setLabel()` methods when updating your tile to set the fields to new values.

You must call `updateTile()` to update your tile once you're done setting the
fields of the `Tile` object to the correct values. This will make the system
parse the updated tile data and update the UI.

### Kotlin

```kotlin
data class StateModel(val enabled: Boolean, val label: String, val icon: Icon)

override fun onStartListening() {
  super.onStartListening()
  val state = getStateFromService()
  qsTile.label = state.label
  qsTile.contentDescription = tile.label
  qsTile.state = if (state.enabled) Tile.STATE_ACTIVE else Tile.STATE_INACTIVE
  qsTile.icon = state.icon
  qsTile.updateTile()
}
```

### Java

```java
public class StateModel {
  final boolean enabled;
  final String label;
  final Icon icon;

  public StateModel(boolean e, String l, Icon i) {
    enabled = e;
    label = l;
    icon = i;
  }
}

@Override
public void onStartListening() {
  super.onStartListening();
  StateModel state = getStateFromService();
  Tile tile = getQsTile();
  tile.setLabel(state.label);
  tile.setContentDescription(state.label);
  tile.setState(state.enabled ? Tile.STATE_ACTIVE : Tile.STATE_INACTIVE);
  tile.setIcon(state.icon);
  tile.updateTile();
}
```

### Handle taps

Users can tap on your tile to trigger an action if your tile is in
`STATE_ACTIVE` or `STATE_INACTIVE`. The system then invokes your app's
[`onClick()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#onClick()) callback.

Once your app receives a callback to `onClick()`, it can launch a dialog or
activity, trigger background work, or change the state of your tile.

### Kotlin

```kotlin
var clicks = 0
override fun onClick() {
  super.onClick()
  counter++
  qsTile.state = if (counter % 2 == 0) Tile.STATE_ACTIVE else Tile.STATE_INACTIVE
  qsTile.label = "Clicked $counter times"
  qsTile.contentDescription = qsTile.label
  qsTile.updateTile()
}
```

### Java

```java
int clicks = 0;

@Override
public void onClick() {
  super.onClick();
  counter++;
  Tile tile = getQsTile();
  tile.setState((counter % 2 == 0) ? Tile.STATE_ACTIVE : Tile.STATE_INACTIVE);
  tile.setLabel("Clicked " + counter + " times");
  tile.setContentDescription(tile.getLabel());
  tile.updateTile();
}
```

#### Launch a dialog

[`showDialog()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#showDialog(android.app.Dialog)) collapses the Quick Settings panel and shows a dialog.
Use a dialog to add context to your action if it requires additional input
or user consent.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** [`isLocked()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#isLocked()) checks if the user's lock screen is showing. When `isLocked()` returns true, `showDialog()` doesn't present a visible dialog because it loads under the lock screen.

#### Launch an activity

[`startActivityAndCollapse()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#startActivityAndCollapse(android.app.PendingIntent)) starts an activity while collapsing the
panel. Activities are useful if there's more detailed information to display
than within a dialog, or if your action is highly interactive.

If your app requires significant user interaction, the app should launch an
activity only as a last resort. Instead, consider using a dialog or a toggle.

Long-tapping a tile prompts the **App Info** screen for the user. To override
this behavior and instead launch an activity for setting preferences, add an
`<intent-filter>` to one of your activities with
[`ACTION_QS_TILE_PREFERENCES`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#ACTION_QS_TILE_PREFERENCES).

Starting with Android API 28, the `PendingIntent` must
have the `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`:

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 28) {
        intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
    }

You can alternatively add the flag in the `AndroidManifest.xml` in the specific
`Activity` section.

### Mark your tile as toggleable

We recommend marking your tile as toggleable if it functions primarily as a
two-state switch (which is the most common behavior of tiles). This helps
provide information about the behavior of the tile to the operating system and
improve overall accessibility.

Set the `TOGGLEABLE_TILE` metadata to `true` to mark your tile as toggleable.

    <service ...>
      <meta-data android:name="android.service.quicksettings.TOGGLEABLE_TILE"
        android:value="true" />
    </service>

### Perform only safe actions on securely-locked devices

Your tile may display on top of the lock screen on locked devices. If the tile
contains sensitive information, check the value of [`isSecure()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService.html?utm_campaign=adp_series_quicksettingstiles_092916&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog#isSecure()) to
determine whether the device is in a secure state, and your `TileService` should
change its behavior accordingly.

If the tile action is safe to perform while locked, use [`startActivity()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContextWrapper#startActivity(android.content.Intent))
to launch an activity on top of the lock screen.

If the tile action is unsafe, use [`unlockAndRun()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/quicksettings/TileService#unlockAndRun(java.lang.Runnable)) to prompt the user to
unlock their device. If successful, the system executes the
[`Runnable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Runnable) object that you pass into this
method.

## Categorize your tile

To enhance the user experience in Quick Settings, you can categorize your tile.
The system organizes tiles into categories such as Connectivity, Display, and
Privacy. The system uses these categories to sort and group tiles in the Quick
Settings edit mode, which makes them easier for users to find and manage.

### Implementation

To specify a category for your `TileService`, add a metadata field to the
service declaration in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

- In your `AndroidManifest.xml`, within the `<service>` element for your `TileService`, add a `<meta-data>` element.
- `android:name`: Set this value to `android.service.quicksettings.TILE_CATEGORY`.
- `android:value`: Assign one of the predefined category constants, such as `android.service.quicksettings.CATEGORY_CONNECTIVITY` or `android.service.quicksettings.CATEGORY_DISPLAY`.

As shown in the following example:

    <service
        android:name=".MyConnectivityTileService"
        [...]
        >
        <meta-data android:name="android.service.quicksettings.TILE_CATEGORY"
            android:value="android.service.quicksettings.CATEGORY_CONNECTIVITY" />
    </service>

The API provides a set of predefined categories to choose from. These categories
are defined as string constants within the `TileService` class.

If a category is not specified, the system automatically assigns a default
category:

- **From system apps:** For tiles that are part of a system application.
- **From apps you installed:** For tiles from user-installed applications.

Although Google Pixel devices make use of categories in Quick Settings,
OEMs can either use or disregard this category information in their respective
system UIs.

## Prompt the user to add your tile

To manually add your tile, users must follow several steps:

1. Swipe down to open the Quick Settings panel.
2. Tap the edit button.
3. Scroll through all tiles on their device until they locate your tile.
4. Hold down your tile, and drag it to the list of active tiles.

The user can also move or remove your tile at any point.

Starting on Android 13, you can use the [`requestAddTileService()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/StatusBarManager#requestAddTileService(android.content.ComponentName,%20java.lang.CharSequence,%20android.graphics.drawable.Icon,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20java.util.function.Consumer%3Cjava.lang.Integer%3E)) method
to make it much easier for users to add your tile to a device. This method
prompts users with a request to quickly add your tile directly to their Quick
Settings panel. The prompt includes the application name, the provided label,
and icon.
![Quick Settings Placement API prompt](https://developer.android.com/static/develop/ui/views/images/placement-api-user-prompt.png) **Figure 5.** Quick Settings Placement API prompt.

    public void requestAddTileService (
      ComponentName tileServiceComponentName,
      CharSequence tileLabel,
      Icon icon,
      Executor resultExecutor,
      Consumer<Integer> resultCallback
    )

The callback contains information about whether or not the tile was added, not
added, if it was already there, or if any error occurred.

Use your discretion when deciding when and how often to prompt users. We
recommend calling `requestAddTileService()` only in context -- such as
when the user first interacts with a feature that your tile facilitates.

The system can choose to stop processing requests for a given
[`ComponentName`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ComponentName) if it has been denied by the user enough times before. The
user is determined from the [`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context) used to retrieve this
service---it must match the current user.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** We recommend calling `requestAddTileService()` to increase the discoverability of your tile and reduce the burden on the user to add your tile to their Quick Settings panel.
