Your app might need to get the user's attention urgently in certain situations,
such as an ongoing alarm or an incoming call. In apps targeting devices that run
Android 9 (API level 28) or earlier, you might handle this by launching an
activity while the app is in the background. This document shows how to achieve
this behavior on devices running Android 10 (API level 29) to
Android 13 (API level 33).

## Add the POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission

Starting in Android 13, add the following line to your
`AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
    <application ...>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Once you have this, you can create a notification channel.

## Create a notification channel

Create a notification channel to properly display your notifications and let the
user manage notifications in the app settings. For more information about
notification channels, see [Create and manage notification
channels](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/channels).

Create your notification channels in your `Application` class's
[`onCreate`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application#onCreate()) method:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
class DACapp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        val channel = NotificationChannel(
            CHANNEL_ID,
            "High priority notifications",
            NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH
        )

        val notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager
        notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)
    }
}
```

When the user runs your app for the first time, they see something like figure 1
in your app's **App info** system screen:
![An image showing the App Info, Notification screen of your app.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/time-sensitive_notification_channel_empty.png) **Figure 1.** Notifications section in the **App
Info** screen of the app's system settings.

## Manage notifications permissions

Starting in Android 13, request notification permissions before
you show notifications to users.

The minimum implementation looks like this:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val permissionLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(
    contract = ActivityResultContracts.RequestPermission(),
    onResult = { hasNotificationPermission = it }
)
...
Button(
    onClick = {
        if (!hasNotificationPermission) {
            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU) {
                permissionLauncher.launch(Manifest.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS)
            }
        }
    },
) {
    Text(text = "Request permission")
}
```

If your device is running Android 13, tapping the `Request
permission` button triggers the dialog shown in figure 2:
![An image showing the permission request dialog](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/time-sensitive_notification_permission_request_dialog.png) **Figure 2.** System dialog for the notification permission request.

If the user accepts the permission request, the app's **App info** section looks
like figure 3:
![An image showing the App Info screen after granted notification permission request](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/time-sensitive_notification_permission_granted.png) **Figure 3.** Notification permissions granted.

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental:** See the Accompanist [Jetpack Compose
> Permissions](https://google.github.io/accompanist/permissions/) library for experimental permission management.

## Create a high-priority notification

When creating the notification, include a descriptive title and message.

The following example contains a notification:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
private fun showNotification() {
    val notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager

    val notificationBuilder =
        NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
            .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.baseline_auto_awesome_24)
            .setContentTitle("HIGH PRIORITY")
            .setContentText("Check this dog puppy video NOW!")
            .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)
            .setCategory(NotificationCompat.CATEGORY_RECOMMENDATION)

    notificationManager.notify(666, notificationBuilder.build())
}
```

## Display the notification to the user

Calling the `showNotification()` function triggers the notification as follows:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
Button(onClick = { showNotification() }) {
    Text(text = "Show notification")
}
```

The notification in this example looks like figure 4:
![An image showing a high priority notification](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/time-sensitive_notification.png) **Figure 4.** A high-priority notification.

## Ongoing notification

When you display your notification to the user, they can acknowledge or dismiss
your app's alert or reminder. For example, the user can accept or reject an
incoming phone call.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** While the user is using the device, the system UI might display a heads-up notification instead of launching your full-screen intent.

If your notification is an ongoing one, such as an incoming phone call,
associate the notification with a [foreground
service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services#Foreground). The following code snippet
shows how to display a notification associated with a foreground service:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
// Provide a unique integer for the "notificationId" of each notification.
startForeground(notificationId, notification)
```

### Java

```java
// Provide a unique integer for the "notificationId" of each notification.
startForeground(notificationId, notification);
```
