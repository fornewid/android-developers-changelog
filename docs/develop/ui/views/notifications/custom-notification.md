To make your notifications look their best across different versions of Android,
use the [standard notification
template](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/build-notification) to build your
notifications. If you want to provide more content in your notification,
consider using one of the [expandable notification
templates](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/expanded).

However, if the system templates don't meet your needs, you can use your own
layout for the notification.
| **Caution:** When using a custom notification layout, take special care to ensure your custom layout works with different device orientations and resolutions. Although this advice applies to all UI layouts, it's especially important for notifications because the space in the notification drawer is restricted. The height available for a custom notification layout depends on the Android version. On some versions, collapsed view layouts are limited to as little as 48 dp, heads-up view layouts are limited to as little as 88 dp, and expanded view layouts are limited to as little as 252 dp.

## Create custom layout for the content area

If you need a custom layout, you can apply
[`NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle)
to your notification. This API lets you provide a custom layout for the content
area normally occupied by the title and text content, while still using system
decorations for the notification icon, timestamp, sub-text, and action buttons.

This API works similarly to the [expandable notification templates](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/expanded) by building on the basic notification
layout as follows:

1. Build a [basic notification](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/build-notification) with [`NotificationCompat.Builder`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder).
2. Call [`setStyle()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setStyle(androidx.core.app.NotificationCompat.Style)), passing it an instance of [`NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle).
3. Inflate your custom layout as an instance of [`RemoteViews`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RemoteViews).
4. Call [`setCustomContentView()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setCustomContentView(android.widget.RemoteViews)) to set the layout for the collapsed notification.
5. Optionally, also call [`setCustomBigContentView()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setCustomBigContentView(android.widget.RemoteViews)) to set a different layout for the expanded notification.

| **Note:** If you're creating a customized notification for media playback controls, follow the same recommendations but use the `NotificationCompat.DecoratedMediaCustomViewStyle` class instead.

### Prepare the layouts

You need a `small` and `large` layout. For this example, the `small` layout
might look like this:  

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:orientation="vertical">

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/notification_title"
            style="@style/TextAppearance.Compat.Notification.Title"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="0dp"
            android:layout_weight="1"
            android:text="Small notification, showing only a title" />
    </LinearLayout>

And the `large` layout might look like this:  

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="300dp"
        android:orientation="vertical">

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/notification_title"
            style="@style/TextAppearance.Compat.Notification.Title"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_weight="1"
            android:text="Large notification, showing a title and a body." />

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/notification_body"
            style="@style/TextAppearance.Compat.Notification.Line2"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_weight="1"
            android:text="This is the body. The height is manually forced to 300dp." />
    </LinearLayout>

### Build and show the notification

After the layouts are ready, you can use them as shown in the following example:  

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val notificationManager = getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager

// Get the layouts to use in the custom notification.
val notificationLayout = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.notification_small)
val notificationLayoutExpanded = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.notification_large)

// Apply the layouts to the notification.
val customNotification = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
        .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
        .setStyle(NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle())
        .setCustomContentView(notificationLayout)
        .setCustomBigContentView(notificationLayoutExpanded)
        .build()

notificationManager.notify(666, customNotification)
```

### Java

```java
NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);

// Get the layouts to use in the custom notification
RemoteViews notificationLayout = new RemoteViews(getPackageName(), R.layout.notification_small);
RemoteViews notificationLayoutExpanded = new RemoteViews(getPackageName(), R.layout.notification_large);

// Apply the layouts to the notification.
Notification customNotification = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
        .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.notification_icon)
        .setStyle(new NotificationCompat.DecoratedCustomViewStyle())
        .setCustomContentView(notificationLayout)
        .setCustomBigContentView(notificationLayoutExpanded)
        .build();

notificationManager.notify(666, customNotification);
```

Be aware that the background color for the notification can vary across devices
and versions. Apply Support Library styles such as
`TextAppearance_Compat_Notification` for the text and
`TextAppearance_Compat_Notification_Title` for the title in your custom layout,
as shown in the following example. These styles adapt to the color variations so
you don't end up with black-on-black or white-on-white text.  

```xml
<TextView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:text="@string/notification_title"
    android:id="@+id/notification_title"
    style="@style/TextAppearance.Compat.Notification.Title" />
```

Avoid setting a background image on your `RemoteViews` object, because your text
might become unreadable.

When you trigger a notification while the user is using an app, the result is
similar to figure 1:
![An image showing a collapsed notification](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/custom_notification_small_inapp.png) **Figure 1.** A small notification layout appears while using other apps.

Tapping the expander arrow expands the notification, as shown in figure 2:
![An image showing an expanded notification in the system bar](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/custom_notification_large_inapp.png) **Figure 2.** A large notification layout appears while using other apps.

After the notification timeout runs out, the notification is visible only in the
system bar, which looks like figure 3:
![An image showing a collapsed notification in the system bar](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/custom_notification_small_system.png) **Figure 3.** How the small notification layout appears in the system bar.

Tapping the expander arrow expands the notification, as shown in figure 4:
![An image showing an expanded notification in the system bar](https://developer.android.com/static/images/ui/notifications/custom_notification_large_system.png) **Figure 4.** A large notification layout appears in the system bar.

## Create a fully custom notification layout

| **Note:** Apps targeting [Android
| 12](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#custom-notifications) (API level 31) or later can't create fully custom notifications. Instead, the system applies a standard template nearly identical to the behavior of [`Notification.DecoratedCustomViewStyle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.DecoratedCustomViewStyle).

If you don't want your notification decorated with the standard notification
icon and header, follow the preceding steps but *don't* call `setStyle()`.
| **Caution:** We don't recommend using an undecorated notification as this doesn't match other notifications and can cause significant layout compatibility issues on devices that apply different styling to the notification area.
