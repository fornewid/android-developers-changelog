Android apps send and receive broadcast messages from the Android system and
other Android apps, similar to the [publish-subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) design pattern. The
system and apps typically send broadcasts when certain events occur. For
example, the Android system
sends broadcasts when various system events occur, such as system boot or device
charging. Apps also send custom broadcasts, for example, to notify other apps of
something that might interest them (for example, new data download).

Apps can register to receive specific broadcasts. When a broadcast is sent, the
system automatically routes broadcasts to apps that have subscribed to receive
that particular type of broadcast.

Generally speaking, broadcasts can be used as a messaging system across apps and
outside of the normal user flow. However, you must be careful not to abuse the
opportunity to respond to broadcasts and run jobs in the background that can
contribute to a slow system performance.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The system optimizes the delivery of broadcasts in order to maintain optimal system health. Therefore, delivery times of broadcasts are not guaranteed. Apps that need low-latency interprocess communication should consider [bound services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

## About system broadcasts

The system automatically sends broadcasts when various system events occur, such
as when the system switches in and out of Airplane Mode. All subscribed apps
receive these broadcasts.

The `Intent` object wraps the broadcast message. The `action` string identifies
the event that occurred, such as `android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE`. The
intent might also include additional information bundled into its extra field.
For example, the Airplane Mode intent includes a boolean extra that indicates
whether or not Airplane Mode is on.

For more information about how to read intents and get the action string from an
intent, see [Intents and Intent Filters](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters).

### System broadcast actions

For a complete list of system broadcast actions, see the `BROADCAST_ACTIONS.TXT`
file in the Android SDK. Each broadcast action has a constant field associated
with it. For example, the value of the constant
[`ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED) is `android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE`.
Documentation for each broadcast action is available in its associated constant
field.

### Changes to system broadcasts

As the Android platform evolves, it periodically changes how system broadcasts
behave. Keep the following changes in mind to support all versions of Android.

#### Android 16

In [Android 16](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#ordered-broadcast-priority), broadcast delivery order using the [`android:priority`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element#priority)
attribute or [`IntentFilter.setPriority()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter#setPriority(int)) across different processes
won't be guaranteed. Broadcast priorities are only respected
within the same application process rather than across all processes.

Also, broadcast priorities are automatically confined to the range
([`SYSTEM_LOW_PRIORITY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter#SYSTEM_LOW_PRIORITY) + 1, [`SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter#SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY) - 1).
Only system components are allowed to set `SYSTEM_LOW_PRIORITY`,
`SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY` as broadcast priority.

#### Android 14

While apps are in a [cached state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle), the system optimizes broadcast delivery
for system health. For example, the system defers less important system
broadcasts such as [`ACTION_SCREEN_ON`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_SCREEN_ON) while the app is in a cached state.
Once the app goes from the cached state into an [active process lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle),
the system delivers any deferred broadcasts.

Important broadcasts that are [declared in the manifest](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/broadcasts#manifest-declared-receivers) temporarily remove
apps from the cached state for delivery.

#### Android 9

Beginning with Android 9 (API level 28), The [`NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)
broadcast doesn't receive information about the user's location or personally
identifiable data.

If your app is installed on a device running Android 9.0 (API level 28) or
higher, the system doesn't include SSIDs, BSSIDs, connection information, or
scan results in Wi-Fi broadcasts. To get this information, call
[`getConnectionInfo()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#getConnectionInfo()) instead.

#### Android 8.0

Beginning with Android 8.0 (API level 26), the system imposes additional
restrictions on manifest-declared receivers.

If your app targets Android 8.0 or higher, you cannot use the manifest to
declare a receiver for most implicit broadcasts (broadcasts that don't target
your app specifically). You can still use a [context-registered receiver](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/broadcasts#context-registered-receivers)
when the user is actively using your app.

#### Android 7.0

Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher don't send the following system
broadcasts:

- [`ACTION_NEW_PICTURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera#ACTION_NEW_PICTURE)
- [`ACTION_NEW_VIDEO`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera#ACTION_NEW_VIDEO)

Also, apps targeting Android 7.0 and higher must register the
[`CONNECTIVITY_ACTION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#CONNECTIVITY_ACTION) broadcast using
[`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/ContextCompat#registerReceiver(android.content.Context,android.content.BroadcastReceiver,android.content.IntentFilter,int)). Declaring a receiver
in the manifest doesn't work.

## Receive broadcasts

Apps can receive broadcasts in two ways: through context-registered receivers
and manifest-declared receivers.

### Context-registered receivers

Context-registered receivers receive broadcasts as long as their registering
context is valid. This is typically between the calls to `registerReceiver` and
`unregisterReceiver`. The registering context also becomes invalid when the
system destroys the corresponding context. For example, if you register within
an [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) context, you receive broadcasts as long as the activity
remains active. If you register with the Application context, you receive
broadcasts as long as the app runs.

To register a receiver with a context, perform the following steps:

1. In your app's module-level build file, include version 1.9.0 or higher of
   the [AndroidX Core library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core):

   ### Groovy

   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       def core_version = "1.17.0"

       // Java language implementation
       implementation "androidx.core:core:$core_version"
       // Kotlin
       implementation "androidx.core:core-ktx:$core_version"

       // To use RoleManagerCompat
       implementation "androidx.core:core-role:1.1.0"

       // To use the Animator APIs
       implementation "androidx.core:core-animation:1.0.0"
       // To test the Animator APIs
       androidTestImplementation "androidx.core:core-animation-testing:1.0.0"

       // Optional - To enable APIs that query the performance characteristics of GMS devices.
       implementation "androidx.core:core-performance:1.0.0"

       // Optional - to use ShortcutManagerCompat to donate shortcuts to be used by Google
       implementation "androidx.core:core-google-shortcuts:1.1.0"

       // Optional - to support backwards compatibility of RemoteViews
       implementation "androidx.core:core-remoteviews:1.1.0"

       // Optional - APIs for SplashScreen, including compatibility helpers on devices prior Android 12
       implementation "androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.2.0"
   }
   ```

   ### Kotlin

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       val core_version = "1.17.0"

       // Java language implementation
       implementation("androidx.core:core:$core_version")
       // Kotlin
       implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:$core_version")

       // To use RoleManagerCompat
       implementation("androidx.core:core-role:1.1.0")

       // To use the Animator APIs
       implementation("androidx.core:core-animation:1.0.0")
       // To test the Animator APIs
       androidTestImplementation("androidx.core:core-animation-testing:1.0.0")

       // Optional - To enable APIs that query the performance characteristics of GMS devices.
       implementation("androidx.core:core-performance:1.0.0")

       // Optional - to use ShortcutManagerCompat to donate shortcuts to be used by Google
       implementation("androidx.core:core-google-shortcuts:1.1.0")

       // Optional - to support backwards compatibility of RemoteViews
       implementation("androidx.core:core-remoteviews:1.1.0")

       // Optional - APIs for SplashScreen, including compatibility helpers on devices prior Android 12
       implementation("androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.2.0")
   }
   ```
2. Create an instance of [`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver):

   ### Kotlin

       val myBroadcastReceiver = MyBroadcastReceiver()

   ### Java

       MyBroadcastReceiver myBroadcastReceiver = new MyBroadcastReceiver();

3. Create an instance of [`IntentFilter`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter):

   ### Kotlin

       val filter = IntentFilter("com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA")

   ### Java

       IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA");

4. Choose whether the broadcast receiver should be exported and visible to
   other apps on the device. If this receiver is listening for broadcasts sent
   from the system or from other apps---even other apps that you own---use the
   `RECEIVER_EXPORTED` flag. If instead this receiver is listening only for
   broadcasts sent by your app, use the `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` flag.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Some system broadcasts come from highly privileged
   > apps, such as Bluetooth and telephony, that are part of the Android
   > framework but don't run under the system's unique process ID (UID). To
   > receive all system broadcasts, including broadcasts from highly privileged
   > apps, flag your receiver with `RECEIVER_EXPORTED`.
   >
   > If you flag your receiver with `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED`, the
   > receiver is able to receive some system broadcasts and broadcasts from your
   > app, but not broadcasts from the highly privileged apps.
   >
   > If your app is listening for multiple broadcasts, but only some should be
   > flagged `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` and some
   > `RECEIVER_EXPORTED`, partition the broadcasts among different
   > broadcast receivers.

   ### Kotlin

       val listenToBroadcastsFromOtherApps = false
       val receiverFlags = if (listenToBroadcastsFromOtherApps) {
           ContextCompat.RECEIVER_EXPORTED
       } else {
           ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED
       }https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverSnippets.kt#L98-L103

   ### Java

       boolean listenToBroadcastsFromOtherApps = false;
       int receiverFlags = listenToBroadcastsFromOtherApps
               ? ContextCompat.RECEIVER_EXPORTED
               : ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED;https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverJavaSnippets.java#L57-L60

   > [!CAUTION]
   > **Caution:** If you export the broadcast receiver, other apps could send unprotected broadcasts to your app.

5. Register the receiver by calling [`registerReceiver()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/ContextCompat#registerReceiver(android.content.Context,android.content.BroadcastReceiver,android.content.IntentFilter,int)):

   ### Kotlin

       ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, receiverFlags)

   ### Java

       ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, receiverFlags);

6. To stop receiving broadcasts, call
   [`unregisterReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#unregisterReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver)). Be sure to
   unregister the receiver when you no longer need it or the context is no
   longer valid.

#### Unregister your broadcast receiver

While the broadcast receiver is registered, it holds a reference to the Context
that you registered it with. This can potentially cause leaks if the receiver's
registered scope exceeds the Context lifecycle scope. For example, this can
occur when you register a receiver on an Activity scope, but you forget to
unregister it when the system destroys the Activity. Therefore, always
unregister your broadcast receiver.

### Kotlin

    class MyActivity : ComponentActivity() {
        private val myBroadcastReceiver = MyBroadcastReceiver()

        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
            // ...
            ContextCompat.registerReceiver(this, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, receiverFlags)
            setContent { MyApp() }
        }

        override fun onDestroy() {
            super.onDestroy()
            // When you forget to unregister your receiver here, you're causing a leak!
            this.unregisterReceiver(myBroadcastReceiver)
        }
    }https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverSnippets.kt#L216-L240

### Java

    class MyActivity extends ComponentActivity {
        MyBroadcastReceiver myBroadcastReceiver;

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            // ...
            ContextCompat.registerReceiver(this, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, receiverFlags);
            // Set content
        }
    }https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverJavaSnippets.java#L102-L118

#### Register receivers in the smallest scope

Your broadcast receiver should only be registered when you're actually
interested in the result. Choose the smallest possible receiver scope:

- [`LifecycleResumeEffect`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary#LifecycleResumeEffect(kotlin.Any,androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner,kotlin.Function1)) or activity `onResume`/`onPause` lifecycle methods: The broadcast receiver only receives updates while the app is in its resumed state.
- [`LifecycleStartEffect`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary#LifecycleStartEffect(kotlin.Any,androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner,kotlin.Function1)) or activity `onStart`/`onStop` lifecycle methods: The broadcast receiver only receives updates while the app is in its resumed state.
- [`DisposableEffect`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/package-summary#DisposableEffect(kotlin.Any,kotlin.Function1)): The broadcast receiver only receives updates while the composable is in the composition tree. This scope is not attached to the activity lifecycle scope. Consider registering the receiver on the application context. This is because the composable could theoretically outlive the activity lifecycle scope and leak the activity.
- Activity `onCreate`/`onDestroy`: The broadcast receiver receives updates while the activity is in its created state. Make sure to unregister in `onDestroy()` and not `onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)` because this might not be called.
- A custom scope: For example, you can register a receiver in your `ViewModel` scope, so it survives activity recreation. Make sure to use the application context to register the receiver on, as the receiver can outlive the activity lifecycle scope and leak the activity.

#### Create stateful and stateless composable

Compose has stateful and stateless composables. Registering or unregistering a
broadcast receiver inside a composable makes it stateful. The composable is not
a deterministic function that renders the same content when passed the same
parameters. Internal state can change based on calls to the registered broadcast
receiver.

As a best practice in Compose, we recommend that you split your composables into
stateful and stateless versions. Therefore, we recommend that you hoist the
creation of the broadcast receiver out of a Composable to make it stateless:

    @Composable
    fun MyStatefulScreen() {
        val myBroadcastReceiver = remember { MyBroadcastReceiver() }
        val context = LocalContext.current
        LifecycleStartEffect(true) {
            // ...
            ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, flags)
            onStopOrDispose { context.unregisterReceiver(myBroadcastReceiver) }
        }
        MyStatelessScreen()
    }

    @Composable
    fun MyStatelessScreen() {
        // Implement your screen
    }https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverSnippets.kt#L248-L271

### Manifest-declared receivers

If you declare a broadcast receiver in your manifest, the system launches your
app when the broadcast is sent. If the app is not already running, the system
launches the app.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If your app targets API level 26 or higher, you cannot use the manifest to declare a receiver for *implicit* broadcasts, except for a few implicit broadcasts that are [exempted from that restriction](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcast-exceptions). Implicit broadcasts are broadcasts that don't target your app specifically. In most cases, you can use [scheduled jobs](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/scheduling) instead.

To declare a broadcast receiver in the manifest, perform the following steps:

1. Specify the [`<receiver>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element) element in your app's manifest.

       <!-- If this receiver listens for broadcasts sent from the system or from
            other apps, even other apps that you own, set android:exported to "true". -->
       <receiver android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="false">
           <intent-filter>
               <action android:name="com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA" />
           </intent-filter>
       </receiver>https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L34-L40

   The intent filters specify the broadcast actions your receiver subscribes
   to.
2. Subclass [`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) and implement
   [`onReceive(Context, Intent)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent)). The broadcast receiver in the following
   example logs and displays the contents of the broadcast:

   ### Kotlin

       class MyBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {

           @Inject
           lateinit var dataRepository: DataRepository

           override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
               if (intent.action == "com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA") {
                   val data = intent.getStringExtra("com.example.snippets.DATA") ?: "No data"
                   // Do something with the data, for example send it to a data repository:
                   dataRepository.updateData(data)
               }
           }
       }https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverSnippets.kt#L66-L78

   ### Java

       public static class MyBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

           @Inject
           DataRepository dataRepository;

           @Override
           public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
               if (Objects.equals(intent.getAction(), "com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA")) {
                   String data = intent.getStringExtra("com.example.snippets.DATA");
                   // Do something with the data, for example send it to a data repository:
                   if (data != null) { dataRepository.updateData(data); }
               }
           }
       }https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverJavaSnippets.java#L24-L37

The system package manager registers the receiver when the app is installed. The
receiver then becomes a separate entry point into your app which means that the
system can start the app and deliver the broadcast if the app is not running.

The system creates a new [`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) component object to handle
each broadcast that it receives. This object is valid only for the duration of
the call to [`onReceive(Context, Intent)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent)). Once your code returns from this
method, the system considers the component no longer active.

### Effects on process state

Whether your [`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) is operating or not affects its contained
process, which can alter its system-killing likelihood. A foreground process
executes a receiver's [`onReceive()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent)) method. The system runs the process
except under extreme memory pressure.

The system deactivates the `BroadcastReceiver` after `onReceive()`.
The receiver's
host process's significance depends on its app components. If that process hosts
only a manifest-declared receiver, the system might kill it after `onReceive()`
to free resources for other more critical processes. This is common for apps the
user has never or not recently interacted with.

Thus, broadcast receivers shouldn't initiate long-running background threads.
The system can stop the process at any moment after `onReceive()` to reclaim
memory, terminating the created thread. To keep the process alive, schedule a
[`JobService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobService) from the receiver using the [`JobScheduler`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler) so the
system knows the process is still working. [Background Work Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/background)
provides more details.

## Send broadcasts

Android provides two ways for apps to send broadcasts:

- The [`sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String)) method sends broadcasts to one receiver at a time. As each receiver executes in turn, it can propagate a result to the next receiver. It can also completely abort the broadcast so that it doesn't reach other receivers. You can control the order in which receivers run within the same app process. To do so, use the `android:priority` attribute of the matching intent-filter. Receivers with the same priority are run in an arbitrary order.
- The [`sendBroadcast(Intent)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String)) method sends broadcasts to all receivers in an undefined order. This is called a Normal Broadcast. This is more efficient, but means that receivers cannot read results from other receivers, propagate data received from the broadcast, or abort the broadcast.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to send a broadcast by creating an
Intent and calling [`sendBroadcast(Intent)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendBroadcast(android.content.Intent)).

### Kotlin

    val intent = Intent("com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA").apply {
        putExtra("com.example.snippets.DATA", newData)
        setPackage("com.example.snippets")
    }
    context.sendBroadcast(intent)https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverSnippets.kt#L127-L131

### Java

    Intent intent = new Intent("com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA");
    intent.putExtra("com.example.snippets.DATA", newData);
    intent.setPackage("com.example.snippets");
    context.sendBroadcast(intent);https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverJavaSnippets.java#L84-L87

The broadcast message is wrapped in an [`Intent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) object. The intent's
`action` string must provide the app's Java package name syntax and uniquely
identify the broadcast event. You can attach additional information to the
intent with [`putExtra(String, Bundle)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/ContextCompat#registerReceiver(android.content.Context,android.content.BroadcastReceiver,android.content.IntentFilter,int)). You can also limit a broadcast to
a set of apps in the same organization by calling [`setPackage(String)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#setPackage(java.lang.String)) on
the intent.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Although you can use intents for both sending broadcasts and starting activities with [`startActivity(Intent)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#startActivity(android.content.Intent)), these actions are completely unrelated. Broadcast receivers can't see or capture intents used to start an activity; likewise, when you broadcast an intent, you can't find or start an activity.

## Restrict broadcasts with permissions

Permissions allow you to restrict broadcasts to the set of apps that hold
certain permissions. You can enforce restrictions on either the sender or
receiver of a broadcast.

### Send broadcasts with permissions

When you call [`sendBroadcast(Intent, String)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String)) or
[`sendOrderedBroadcast(Intent, String, BroadcastReceiver, Handler, int, String,
Bundle)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.os.Handler,%20int,%20java.lang.String,%20android.os.Bundle))
, you can specify a permission parameter. Only receivers who have requested that
permission with the `<uses-permission>` tag in their manifest can receive the
broadcast. If the permission is dangerous, you must grant the permission before
the receiver can receive the broadcast. For example, the following code sends a
broadcast with a permission:

### Kotlin

    context.sendBroadcast(intent, android.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)

### Java

    context.sendBroadcast(intent, android.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION);

To receive the broadcast, the receiving app must request the permission as
follows:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

You can specify either an existing system permission like
[`BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#BLUETOOTH_CONNECT) or define a custom permission with the
[`<permission>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element) element. For information on permissions and security in
general, see the [System Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Custom permissions are registered when the app is installed. The app that defines the custom permission must be installed before the app that uses it.

### Receive broadcasts with permissions

If you specify a permission parameter when registering a broadcast receiver
(either with
[`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter, String, Handler)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter,%20java.lang.String,%20android.os.Handler)) or in
[`<receiver>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element) tag in your manifest), then only broadcasters who have
requested the permission with the [`<uses-permission>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-permission-element) tag in their
manifest can send an Intent to the receiver. If the permission is dangerous,
the broadcaster must also be granted the permission.

For example, assume your receiving app has a manifest-declared receiver as
follows:

    <!-- If this receiver listens for broadcasts sent from the system or from
         other apps, even other apps that you own, set android:exported to "true". -->
    <receiver
        android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiverWithPermission"
        android:permission="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"
        android:exported="true">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA" />
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L43-L52

Or your receiving app has a context-registered receiver as follows:

### Kotlin

    ContextCompat.registerReceiver(
        context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter,
        android.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION,
        null, // scheduler that defines thread, null means run on main thread
        receiverFlags
    )https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverSnippets.kt#L111-L116

### Java

    ContextCompat.registerReceiver(
            context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter,
            android.Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION,
            null, // scheduler that defines thread, null means run on main thread
            receiverFlags
    );https://github.com/android/snippets/blob/df2de96bc6313883ec381bd33c9df6b614bd9325/misc/src/main/java/com/example/snippets/BroadcastReceiverJavaSnippets.java#L68-L73

Then, to be able to send broadcasts to those receivers, the sending app must
request the permission as follows:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

## Security considerations

Here are some security considerations for sending and receiving broadcasts:

- If many apps have registered to receive the same broadcast in their
  manifest, it can cause the system to launch a lot of apps, causing a
  substantial impact on both device performance and user experience. To avoid
  this, prefer using context registration over manifest declaration. Sometimes,
  the Android system itself enforces the use of context-registered receivers.
  For example, the [`CONNECTIVITY_ACTION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#CONNECTIVITY_ACTION) broadcast is delivered only to
  context-registered receivers.

- Don't broadcast sensitive information using an implicit intent. Any app can
  read the information if it registers to receive the broadcast.
  There are three ways to control who can receive your broadcasts:

  - You can specify a permission when sending a broadcast.
  - In Android 4.0 (API level 14) and higher, you can specify a [package](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element#package) with [`setPackage(String)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#setPackage(java.lang.String)) when sending a broadcast. The system restricts the broadcast to the set of apps that match the package.
- When you register a receiver, any app can send potentially malicious
  broadcasts to your app's receiver. There are several ways to limit the
  broadcasts that your app receives:

  - You can specify a permission when registering a broadcast receiver.
  - For manifest-declared receivers, you can set the [android:exported](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element#exported) attribute to "false" in the manifest. The receiver does not receive broadcasts from sources outside of the app.
- The namespace for broadcast actions is global. Make sure that action names
  and other strings are written in a namespace you own. Otherwise, you may
  inadvertently conflict with other apps.

- Because a receiver's [`onReceive(Context, Intent)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent)) method runs on the
  main thread, it should execute
  and return quickly. If you need to perform long-running work, be careful
  about spawning threads or starting background services because the system
  can kill the entire process after `onReceive()` returns. For more
  information, see [Effect on process state](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/broadcasts#effects-process-state) To perform long running work,
  we recommend:

  - Calling [`goAsync()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#goAsync()) in your receiver's `onReceive()` method and passing the [`BroadcastReceiver.PendingResult`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.PendingResult) to a background thread. This keeps the broadcast active after returning from `onReceive()`. However, even with this approach the system expects you to finish with the broadcast very quickly (under 10 seconds). It does allow you to move work to another thread to avoid glitching the main thread.
  - Scheduling a job with the [`JobScheduler`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler). For more information, see [Intelligent Job Scheduling](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/scheduling).
- Don't start activities from broadcast receivers because the user experience
  is jarring; especially if there is more than one receiver. Instead, consider
  displaying a [notification](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications).
