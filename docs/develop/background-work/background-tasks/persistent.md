When you want to execute tasks that will continue to run even if the app leaves
the visible state, we recommend using the Jetpack library [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkManager).
WorkManager features a robust scheduling mechanism that lets tasks persist
across app restarts and device reboots.

## Types of work

WorkManager handles three types of work:

- **Immediate**: Tasks that must begin immediately and complete soon. May be expedited.
- **Long Running**: Tasks which might run for longer, potentially longer than 10 minutes.
- **Deferrable**: Scheduled tasks that start at a later time and can run periodically.

Figure 1 outlines how the different types of tasks relate to one
another.
![Persistent work may be immediate, long running, or deferrable](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/background/workmanager_main.svg) **Figure 1**: Types of work.

Similarly, the following table outlines the various types of work.

| Type | Periodicity | How to access |
|---|---|---|
| Immediate | One time | `OneTimeWorkRequest` and `Worker`. For expedited work, call `setExpedited()` on your OneTimeWorkRequest. |
| Long Running | One time or periodic | Any `WorkRequest` or `Worker`. Call `setForeground()` in the Worker to handle the notification. |
| Deferrable | One time or periodic | `PeriodicWorkRequest` and `Worker`. |

For more information regarding how to set up WorkManager, see the [Defining your
WorkRequests](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/define-work#work-constraints) guide.

## WorkManager Features

In addition to providing a simpler and more consistent API, WorkManager has a
number of other key benefits:

### Work constraints

Declaratively define the optimal conditions for your work to run using [work
constraints](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/define-work#work-constraints). For example, run only when the device is on an unmetered
network, when the device is idle, or when it has sufficient battery.

### Robust scheduling

WorkManager allows you to [schedule work](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/define-work) to run [one-time](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/OneTimeWorkRequest) or
[repeatedly](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/PeriodicWorkRequest) using flexible scheduling windows. Work can be tagged and named
as well, allowing you to schedule unique, replaceable work and monitor or cancel
groups of work together.

Scheduled work is stored in an internally managed SQLite database and
WorkManager takes care of ensuring that this work persists and is rescheduled
across device reboots.

In addition, WorkManager adheres to power-saving features and best practices
like [Doze mode](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby), so you don't have to worry about it.

### Expedited work

You can use WorkManager to schedule immediate work for execution in the
background. You should use [Expedited work](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/define-work#expedited) for tasks that are important to
the user and which complete within a few minutes.

### Flexible retry policy

Sometimes work fails. WorkManager offers [flexible retry policies](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/define-work#retries_backoff), including
a configurable [exponential backoff policy](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/BackoffPolicy).

### Work chaining

For complex related work, [chain individual work tasks together](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/chain-work) using an
intuitive interface that allows you to control which pieces run sequentially and
which run in parallel.

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val continuation = WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .beginUniqueWork(
        Constants.IMAGE_MANIPULATION_WORK_NAME,
        ExistingWorkPolicy.REPLACE,
        OneTimeWorkRequest.from(CleanupWorker::class.java)
    ).then(OneTimeWorkRequest.from(WaterColorFilterWorker::class.java))
    .then(OneTimeWorkRequest.from(GrayScaleFilterWorker::class.java))
    .then(OneTimeWorkRequest.from(BlurEffectFilterWorker::class.java))
    .then(
        if (save) {
            workRequest<SaveImageToGalleryWorker>(tag = Constants.TAG_OUTPUT)
        } else /* upload */ {
            workRequest<UploadWorker>(tag = Constants.TAG_OUTPUT)
        }
    )
```

### Java

```java
WorkManager.getInstance(...)
.beginWith(Arrays.asList(workA, workB))
.then(workC)
.enqueue();
```

For each work task, you can [define input and output data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/how-to/define-work#input_output) for that work.
When chaining work together, WorkManager automatically passes output data from
one work task to the next.

### Built-In threading interoperability

WorkManager [integrates seamlessly](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced/threading) with [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced/coroutineworker) and [RxJava](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced/rxworker)
and provides the flexibility to [plug in your own asynchronous APIs](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced/listenableworker).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** While Coroutines and WorkManager are recommended for different use cases, they are not mutually exclusive. You may use coroutines within work scheduled through WorkManager.

## Use WorkManager for reliable work

WorkManager is intended for work that is required to **run reliably** even if
the user navigates off a screen, the app exits, or the device restarts. For
example:

- Sending logs or analytics to backend services.
- Periodically syncing application data with a server.

WorkManager is not intended for in-process background work that can safely be
terminated if the app process goes away. It is also not a general solution for
all work that requires immediate execution. Please review the [background
processing guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/background) to see which solution meets your needs.

## Relationship to other APIs

This table shows how WorkManager relates to similar APIs. This information can
help you choose the right API for your app's requirements.

| API | Recommended for | Relationship to WorkManager |
|---|---|---|
| **Coroutines** | All asynchronous work that doesn't need to persist if the app leaves the visible state. | Coroutines are the standard means of leaving the main thread in Kotlin. However, they stop as soon as the app closes. For work that should persist even after the app closes, use WorkManager. |
| **AlarmManager** | Alarms only. | Unlike WorkManager's regular workers, AlarmManager's exact alarms wake a device from Doze mode. It is therefore not efficient in terms of power and resource management. Only use it for precise alarms or notifications such as calendar events, not for recurring background work. |

## Replace deprecated APIs

The WorkManager API is the recommended replacement for previous Android
background scheduling APIs, including [`FirebaseJobDispatcher`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/migrating-fb) and
[`GcmNetworkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/migrating-gcm).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Your `FirebaseJobDispatcher` and `GcmNetworkManager` API calls no longer work on devices running Android Marshmallow (6.0) and above. Follow the migration guides for [`FirebaseJobDispatcher`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/migrating-fb) and [`GcmNetworkManager`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/migrating-gcm) for guidance on migrating.
