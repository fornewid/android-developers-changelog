Beginning with Android 14 (API level 34), you must declare an appropriate
service type for each foreground service. That means you must declare the
service type in your app manifest, and also request the appropriate foreground
service permission for that type (in addition to requesting the
[`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE)
permission). Furthermore, depending on the foreground service type, you might
have to request runtime permissions before you launch the service.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** In many cases, there are purpose-built APIs you can use instead of creating a particular type of foreground service. When purpose-built APIs are available, they are usually a better choice than creating a foreground service. These APIs are listed in **Alternatives** sections within the appropriate foreground service types.

### Camera

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under `android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `camera`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA)

Runtime prerequisites

:   Request and be granted the [`CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#CAMERA) runtime permission

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** The `CAMERA` runtime permission is subject to while-in-use restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a `camera` foreground service while your app is in the background and you cannot launch a `camera` foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` receiver, [with a few
    > exceptions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions-exemptions). For more information, see [Restrictions on starting foreground services that need while-in-use
    > permissions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions).

Description

:   Continue to access the camera from the background, such as video chat apps
    that allow for multitasking.

    network connection.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** If your app performs a projection or remote messaging operation, use the corresponding [media projection](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/service-types#media-projection) or [remote messaging](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/service-types#remote-messaging) type instead.

Alternatives

:   If your app needs to do continuous data transfer to an external device,
    consider using the [companion device manager](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/companion-device-pairing) instead. Use the [companion
    device presence API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/companion-device-pairing#keep-awake) to help your app stay running while the companion device
    is in range.

:   If your app needs to scan for bluetooth devices, consider using the
    [Bluetooth scan API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/find-ble-devices) instead.

### Data sync

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `dataSync`

      - [`ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION)

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** The `BODY_SENSORS` and sensor-based READ runtime permissions are subject to while-in-use restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a `health` foreground service that uses body sensors while your app is in the background, unless you've been granted the [`BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND) (between API level 33 and API level 35) or [`READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/health/connect/HealthPermissions#READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND) (API level 36) permissions. For more information, see [Restrictions on starting foreground services that need while-in-use permissions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions).

    exercise trackers.

### Location

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `location`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION)

Runtime prerequisites

:   The user must have enabled location services and the app must be granted
    at least one of the following runtime permissions:

    - [`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)
    - [`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** In order to check that the user has enabled location services as well as granted access to the runtime permissions, use [`PermissionChecker#checkSelfPermission()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/PermissionChecker#checkSelfPermission(android.content.Context,java.lang.String))

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** The location runtime permissions are subject to while-in-use restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a `location` foreground service while your app is in the background, unless you've been granted the [`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) runtime permission. For more information, see [Restrictions on starting foreground services that need while-in-use
    > permissions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions).

Description

:   Long-running use cases that require location access, such as navigation and
    location sharing.

Alternatives

:   If your app needs to be triggered when the user reaches specific locations,
    consider using the [geofence API](https://developer.android.com/training/location/geofencing) instead.

### Media

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `mediaPlayback`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK)

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description

:   Continue audio or video playback from the background. Support Digital Video
    Recording (DVR) functionality on [Android TV](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/tif/content-recording).

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a media playback foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver. For more information, see [Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
    > services](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

Alternatives

:   If you're showing picture-in-picture video, use
    [Picture-in-Picture mode](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture).

### Media processing

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `mediaProcessing`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROCESSING`

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROCESSING`

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description

:   Service for performing time-consuming operations on media assets, like
    converting media to different formats. The system allows this service a limited
    time to run; under normal circumstances, this time limit would be 6 hours out of
    every 24. (This limit is shared by all of an app's `mediaProcessing` foreground
    services.)

:   Your app should manually stop the media processing service in the following
    scenario:

    - When the transcoding operation finishes or reaches a failure state, have the service call [`Service.stopForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopForeground(int)) and [`Service.stopSelf()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf()) to stop the service completely.

:   If the timeout period is reached, the system calls the service's
    [`Service.onTimeout(int, int)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#onTimeout(int,%20int)) method. At this
    time, the service has a few
    seconds to call [`Service.stopSelf()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf()). If the service does not call
    `Service.stopSelf()`, an ANR will occur with this error message: "A
    foreground service of *\<fgs_type\>* did not stop within its
    timeout: *\<component_name\>*".

    **Note** : `Service.onTimeout(int, int)` is not available on Android 14
    or lower. On devices running those versions, if a media processing
    service reaches the timeout period, the system immediately caches the app.
    For this reason, your app shouldn't wait to get a timeout notification.
    Instead, it should terminate the foreground service or change it to a
    background service as soon as appropriate.

### Media projection

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `mediaProjection`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROJECTION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MEDIA_PROJECTION)

Runtime prerequisites

:   Call the [`createScreenCaptureIntent()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjectionManager#createScreenCaptureIntent(android.media.projection.MediaProjectionConfig)) method before starting the
    foreground service. Doing so shows a permission notification to the user;
    the user must grant the permission before you can create the service.

:   After you have created the foreground service, you can call
    [`MediaProjectionManager.getMediaProjection()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjectionManager#getMediaProjection(int,%20android.content.Intent)).

Description

:   Project content to non-primary display or external device using the
    [`MediaProjection`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection) APIs. This content doesn't have to be exclusively media
    content.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a media projection foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver. For more information, see [Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
    > services](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

Alternatives

:   To stream media to another device, use the [Google Cast SDK](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender).

### Microphone

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `microphone`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MICROPHONE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_MICROPHONE)

Runtime prerequisites

:   Request and be granted the [`RECORD_AUDIO`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO) runtime permission.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** The `RECORD_AUDIO` runtime permission is subject to while-in-use restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a `microphone` foreground service while your app is in the background and you cannot launch a `microphone` foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` receiver, [with a few
    > exceptions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions-exemptions). For more information, see [Restrictions on starting foreground services that need while-in-use
    > permissions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions).

Description

:   Continue microphone capture from the background, such as voice recorders or
    communication apps.

### Phone call

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `phoneCall`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_PHONE_CALL`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_PHONE_CALL)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_PHONE_CALL`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_PHONE_CALL)

Runtime prerequisites

:   At least one of these conditions must be true:

:
    - App has declared the [`MANAGE_OWN_CALLS`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#MANAGE_OWN_CALLS) permission in its manifest file.
:
    - App is the default dialer app through the [`ROLE_DIALER`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/role/RoleManager#ROLE_DIALER) role.


    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** Apps that target Android 15 or higher are not allowed to launch a phone call foreground service from a `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receiver. For more information, see [Restrictions on `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast receivers launching foreground
    > services](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#fgs-boot-completed).

Description

:   Continue an ongoing call using the [`ConnectionService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/ConnectionService) APIs.

Alternatives

:   If you need to make phone, video, or VoIP calls, consider using the
    [`android.telecom`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/package-summary) library.

:   Consider using [`CallScreeningService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/CallScreeningService) to screen calls.

### Remote messaging

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `remoteMessaging`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_REMOTE_MESSAGING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_REMOTE_MESSAGING)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_REMOTE_MESSAGING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_REMOTE_MESSAGING)

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description
:   Transfer text messages from one device to another. Assists with continuity of
    a user's messaging tasks when they switch devices.

### Short service

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `shortService`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   None

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE)

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description

:   Quickly finish critical work that cannot be interrupted or postponed.

    This type has some unique characteristics:

    - Can only run for a short period of time (about 3 minutes).
    - No support for [sticky](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#START_STICKY) foreground services.
    - Cannot start other foreground services.
    - Doesn't require a [type-specific permission](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/service-types#permission-for-fgs-type), though it still requires the [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE) permission.
    - A `shortService` can only change to another service type if the app is currently eligible to start a new foreground service.
    - A foreground service can change its type to `shortService` at any time, at which point the timeout period begins.

    The timeout for shortService begins from the moment that
    [`Service.startForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#startForeground(int,%20android.app.Notification,%20int)) is called. The app is expected to call
    [`Service.stopSelf()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf()) or [`Service.stopForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopForeground(int)) before the
    timeout occurs. Otherwise, the new `Service.onTimeout()` is called, giving
    apps a brief opportunity to call `stopSelf()` or `stopForeground()` to stop
    their service.

    A short time after `Service.onTimeout()` is called, the app enters a [cached
    state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle) and is no longer considered to be in the foreground, unless the
    user is actively interacting with the app. A short time after the app is
    cached and the service has not stopped, the app receives an [ANR](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr). The
    ANR message mentions `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE`. For these
    reasons, it's considered best practice to implement the
    `Service.onTimeout()` callback.

    The `Service.onTimeout()` callback doesn't exist on Android 13 and lower. If
    the same service runs on such devices, it doesn't receive a timeout, nor
    does it ANR. Make sure that your service stops as soon as it finishes the
    processing task, even if it hasn't received the `Service.onTimeout()`
    callback yet.

    It's important to note that if the timeout of the `shortService` is not
    respected, the app will ANR even if it has other valid foreground services
    or other app lifecycle processes running.

    If an app is visible to the user or satisfies one of the [exemptions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions-exemptions)
    that allow foreground services to be started from the background, calling
    `Service.StartForeground()` again with the
    `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE` parameter extends the timeout by
    another 3 minutes. If the app isn't visible to the user and doesn't
    satisfy one of the [exemptions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions-exemptions), any attempt to start another
    foreground service, regardless of type, causes a
    [`ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException).

    If a user disables [battery optimization](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7015477) for your app, it's
    still affected by the timeout of shortService FGS.

    If you start a foreground service that includes the `shortService` type and
    another foreground service type, the system ignores the `shortService` type
    declaration. However, the service must still adhere to the prerequisites of
    the other declared types. For more information, see the [Foreground services
    documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs).

### Special use

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `specialUse`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE)

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description

:   Covers any valid foreground service use cases that aren't covered by the other
    foreground service types.

    In addition to declaring the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`
    foreground service type, developers should declare use cases in the
    manifest. To do so, they specify the `<property>` element within the
    [`<service>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element) element. These values and corresponding use cases are
    reviewed when you submit your app in the Google Play Console. The use
    cases you provide are free-form, and you should make sure to provide enough
    information to let the reviewer see why you need to use the `specialUse`
    type.

        <service android:name="fooService" android:foregroundServiceType="specialUse">
          <property android:name="android.app.PROPERTY_SPECIAL_USE_FGS_SUBTYPE"
              android:value="explanation_for_special_use"/>
        </service>

### System exempted

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under
`android:foregroundServiceType`
:   `systemExempted`

Permission to declare in your manifest
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED)

Constant to pass to `startForeground()`
:   [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SYSTEM_EXEMPTED)

Runtime prerequisites
:   None

Description

:   Reserved for system applications and specific system integrations, to
    continue to use foreground services.

    To use this type, an app must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- Device is in demo mode state
- App is a [Device Owner](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/provision)
- App is a [Profiler Owner](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/managed-profiles)
- Safety Apps that have the [`ROLE_EMERGENCY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/role/RoleManager#ROLE_EMERGENCY) role
- [Device Admin](https://developer.android.com/work/device-admin) apps
- Apps holding [`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM) or [`USE_EXACT_ALARM`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_EXACT_ALARM) permission
- VPN apps (configured using **Settings \> Network \& Internet \> VPN**)

  Otherwise, declaring this type causes the system to throw a
  `ForegroundServiceTypeNotAllowedException`.

## Google Play policy enforcement for using foreground service types

If your app targets Android 14 or higher, you'll need to declare your app's
foreground service types in the Play Console's app content page (**Policy \>
App content** ). For more information on how to declare your foreground
service types in Play Console, see [Understanding foreground service and
full-screen intent requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821).
