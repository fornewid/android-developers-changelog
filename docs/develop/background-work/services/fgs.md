Foreground services let you asynchronously perform operations that are
noticeable to the user. Foreground services show a [status bar
notification](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications), to make users aware that your
app is performing a task in the foreground and is consuming system resources.

Examples of apps that use foreground services include the following:

- A music player app that plays music in a foreground service. The notification might show the current song being played.
- A fitness app that records a user's run in a foreground service, after receiving permission from the user. The notification might show the distance that the user has traveled during the current fitness session.

Only use a foreground service when your app needs to perform a task
that is noticeable by the user, even when they're not directly interacting with
the app. If the action is of low enough importance that you want to use a
minimum-priority notification, you probably want to use a different
[background work option](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks).
