Android-powered devices have sensors that let you provide users with contextual
information about their surroundings, including location awareness, motion,
position, and qualities of the physical environment.

To provide a much richer, more more context-specific experience for users, use
Android APIs that take advantage of the following types of sensors:

- Use [GPS](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location) to add location awareness to your app with automated location
  tracking, wrong-side-of-the-street detection, geofencing, activity
  recognition, and more.

- Use [motion sensors](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_motion) to measure acceleration forces and rotational forces
  along three axes. This category includes accelerometers, gravity sensors,
  gyroscopes, and rotational vector sensors.

- Use [position sensors](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_position) to measure the physical position of a device. This
  category includes orientation sensors and magnetometers.

- Use [environmental sensors](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_environment) to measure various environmental parameters,
  such as ambient air temperature and pressure, illumination, and humidity.
  This category includes barometers, photometers, and thermometers.
