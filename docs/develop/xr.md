## Build or spatialize an Android app

You can build a new app from scratch or adapt an Android large screen or mobile app for XR immersive experiences by adding spatial components.  
[Develop with Jetpack XR SDK](http://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk)  
Alas, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. That's OK! You can still[download the video](https://developer.android.com/static/videos/design/ui/xr/develop-xr-adapted-opt.mp4)and watch it with a video player.  
This JetNews app is an Android large-screen app adapted for Android XR.
