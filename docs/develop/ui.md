### Develop UI

Jetpack [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation) is the modern Android toolkit for building native UI with intuitive Kotlin APIs. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development, including adaptive design for all form factors---from phones, tablets, and foldables to TVs and wearables.  

Compose provides pre-built UI components so you can implement your app's UI with graphics, animations, and other visual elements with minimal code.  

To maintain any existing views-based UIs in your app, use the [views-based workflows](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/declaring-layout). We recommend migrating your views-based UIs to Compose.
