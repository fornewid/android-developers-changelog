### Games

Get your game on—on all screens for a more visual, more interactive, more immersive gaming experience.

Desktops, laptops, tablets, foldables. Large screen devices are fast becoming the preferred platform of mobile game players. Take advantage of large screens to level up your game with high-resolution graphics, multitasking, multiple input options, and more.

your players pick up where they left off across different form factors and platforms.
