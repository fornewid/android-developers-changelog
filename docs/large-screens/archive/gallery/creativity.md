### Creativity

Help users make the most of the space that's available on their device, offering a variety of options to capture big ideas and fine details.

Imagine. Tablet as creative canvas. Stylus as brush and pen, turning concepts into creations, possibilities into reality, in a large screen design space made for more imagining.
