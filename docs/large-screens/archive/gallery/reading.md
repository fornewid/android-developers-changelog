### Reading

Offer both compact and large-print experiences across your readers' libraries.

Tablets and foldables are perfect for reading. Large screens enable readers to enjoy reading naturally without squinting or pressing their noses to the screen to read tiny text. Treat your users to a delightful, immersive full-screen reading experience, or enable them to explore related content in multi-window mode without closing the book on their reading enjoyment.

Immersive mode

### Full-screen readability

Remove on-screen distractions and annoyances so readers can focus their attention and
immerse themselves in their reading. Adapt line lengths and whitespace to fit
seamlessly with the device's screen size.

### Booklists and buys

Enable book buyers to scan row after row of the latest editions in a large multi-column grid that showcases best sellers or best bargains with prominent size and position. Categorize books in rows or columns for easy identification. Include side navigation to put stacks of paperbacks at shoppers’ tapping or mouse-clicking fingertips.

### Multi-window

With multi-window mode on expansive displays, readers can pore over weighty tomes in one window while taking notes, checking facts, or sharing observations in another window, in another app, instantly.

[See “Support multi-window mode”](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/support-multi-window-mode)

### Book posture

Foldables have the angle on e-books. Capture the experience of reading a real book with a two-page layout on a large screen foldable open like a bound book. It’s an e-book in fact, form, and function.

[See “Make your app fold aware”](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/make-apps-fold-aware#book_mode)

### Drag and drop

With multi-window mode and drag and drop on large screens, readers can copy images, figures, and excerpts from textbooks, journals, or any e-book to a document, chat, or other app easily, directly.

[See “Enable drag and drop”](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/drag-drop)
