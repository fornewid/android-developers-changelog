### Social media & communication

Enable users to create, share, and interact more easily, more naturally, more productively.

Frame discussions in a larger context—include more conversations, more opinions, more ideas. Large screens give users more work space to create, to multitask, to drag and drop content between applications and share it with the world.

List-detail

### Conversations

Display a list of conversations side by side with conversation details to make keeping
up with all the latest messages no problem. Users can scan the list, then simply
select a conversation to see what all the talk is about.

### Dual screen mode

Display content on both screens of a foldable phone simultaneously. Take selfies with the higher resolution rear camera. Make video calls with groups of people. See what I say in different languages with a dual screen interpreter.

[See “Support foldable display modes”](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/foldables/support-foldable-display-modes)

### Drag and drop

Make content sharing simple with spacious layouts that enable natural, fumble-free drag-and-drop interactions within apps and, in multi-window mode, between apps.

[See “Enable drag and drop”](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/drag-drop)

### Picture-in-picture

Display picture-in-picture videos or video calls in the ample space of large screen layouts. Provide a productive, pleasurable user experience with plenty of room for viewing and doing at the same time.

[See “Picture-in-picture (PIP) support”](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture)

### Multi-window

It’s like two devices in one. Double device usability with side-by-side apps in multi-window or multi-instance scenarios. Enable users to research while writing, search while chatting, schedule while video calling.

### Google Duo sees increased engagement and improved ratings by optimizing for larger screens

With the surge in stay-at-home activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Google Duo team saw a significant increase in people using the app to stay
connected with friends and family, school and work. The team took the
opportunity to improve the user experience by optimizing the app layout on
tablets and creating a tabletop layout on foldables for hands-free video calling.
