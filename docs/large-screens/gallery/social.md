![](http://developer.android.com/static/images/large-screens/gallery/icons/social.svg)  

### Social media \& communication

Enable users to create, share, and interact more easily, more naturally, more productively.Frame discussions in a larger context---include more conversations, more opinions, more ideas. Large screens give users more work space to create, to multitask, to drag and drop content between applications and share it with the world.  
List-detail

### Conversations

Display a list of conversations side by side with conversation details to make keeping up with all the latest messages no problem. Users can scan the list, then simply select a conversation to see what all the talk is about.
