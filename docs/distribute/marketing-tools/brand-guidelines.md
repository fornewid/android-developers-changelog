### Android in text

#### Trademark \& Attribution

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/brand/androidtrade-caution.png)

### Caution

Android™ should have a trademark symbol the first time it appears in a creative.
> \> Android is a trademark of Google LLC.

### Caution

Any use of the Android name needs to include this attribution in your communication.

#### 'Android' wordmark alongside logos


If used with your logo, "for Android" or "with Android" should be no larger
than 90% of your logo's size. The first instance of this use should be
followed by a TM symbol: "for Android™".

#### Case / Grammar of 'Android'


Android should always be capitalized and is never plural or possessive.

#### Using 'Android' in application naming


"Android", or anything confusingly similar to "Android", cannot be used in
names of applications or accessory products, including phones, tablets, TVs,
speakers, headphones, watches, and other devices. Instead, use "for Android".

> "Ndroid MediaPlayer"

### Don't


"Android TV", "Android Wear", "Android Auto", "Android Automotive OS",
"Google Pay", and "Android Things" may only be used to identify or market
products or services with prior approval. Use "for Android" or "with Android"
for all other Android-based products.

#### 'Android' as a text descriptor


Android may be used as a descriptor in text, as long as it is followed by a
proper generic term and is not the name of your product, app, or service.
Think of "Android" as a term used in place of "the Android platform."
> "Android features"
