### How SDK providers partner with Google Play

SDK providers can claim and register their SDKs on Google Play SDK Console to see statistics and crash reporting, and to share information with developers. SDK providers can send you urgent messages through Google Play Console and Android Studio. Now if there's an issue, Google Play can warn you about it before you publish an app release with a problematic version.
