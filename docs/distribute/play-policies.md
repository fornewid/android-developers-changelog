| May 2025        | We introduced the Photo and Video Permissions policy to reduce the number of apps permitted to request broad photo/video permissions (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and READ_MEDIA_VIDEO). Apps may only access photos and videos for purposes directly related to app functionality. Developers with apps that carry READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permissions must either submit a declaration form to qualify for core use/broad access or remove permissions (if one time/infrequent use case). Developers may that need more time to submit the completed declaration form may request an extension in[Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers/app/app-content)until**May 28, 2025**. |
