### Teach a Class

The Android Development with Kotlin course is designed for educators to teach the fundamentals of Android development with the Kotlin programming language in a classroom setting.

### Prerequisites

Learners are expected to be familiar with object-oriented programming language, how to use an IDE, and how to use GitHub. No prior experience with Kotlin or Android is necessary. It is recommended that educators complete the course content before teaching it.

### Lecture Slides and Code Samples

The course is 13 lessons long with each lecture being approximately 1 hour long. Each lecture is accompanied by 2 hours of hands-on codelabs for learners to complete on their own. If you're ready to start teaching Android, use these materials to get started today. We have lessons covering the Kotlin language, introduction to Android development, UI basics, Android app architecture, and many others. Use the following slides to deliver lectures in a classroom setting.

### Lead a Study Jam

The Android Study Jams program is designed for a group of people in the community to come together to learn how to build Android apps.

### Prerequisites

No prior experience with programming is necessary. For Study Jams organizers, it is not required to be an expert on the material or to deliver lectures because participants work through a self-paced online curriculum provided by Google. However, we recommend that organizers complete the content before leading the group.

### Guides

These materials can be used in a meetup group, after-school program, or among any group of peers. At the end of the program, you can offer a fun challenge for participants to create an Android app that tackles a local community problem.

- [Organizer guide]() - A thorough guide on how to run Android Study Jams, complete with tips on recruiting participants
- [Presenter guide]() - Tips on how to engage your audience and create slides for sessions
- [Sample slides for Sessions 1 \& 2]() - Slides you can adapt and use to facilitate the initial sessions of Study Jams
- [Download all slides]()

### Learning Pathways

Explore the learning pathways from the [Android Basics in Kotlin course](https://g.co/android/basics) that your participants will be going through as part of Study Jams.
