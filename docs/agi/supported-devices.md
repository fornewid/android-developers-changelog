This page contains a growing list of Android devices that are supported by AGI.

AGI requires support from the Android OS, OEM drivers, and the hardware for GPU
profiling. AGI runs a [validation check](https://developer.android.com/agi/start#device-validation) the first
time you connect a new device to check for profiling support. The devices listed
below and new devices with Android 12 (except some Android-Go devices) are
expected to pass this validation check.

We recommend profiling on a Pixel 4 or 6, as these have been tested with the
most applications on AGI. In the future this level of testing will be expanded
to more devices.

Android emulators are not supported. The following Android devices (when running
Android 11 or higher) are supported by AGI:

| Device name | GPU name |
|---|---|
| Google Pixel 4 (standard and XL) | Qualcomm® Adreno™ 640 |
| Google Pixel 4a | Qualcomm® Adreno™ 618 |
| Google Pixel 4a 5G | Qualcomm® Adreno™ 620 |
| Google Pixel 5 | Qualcomm® Adreno™ 620 |
