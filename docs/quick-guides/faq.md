Quick guides are a new type of documentation designed to help you meet your
goals in a fast and focused way. Quick guides:

- Take a code-first approach whenever possible.
- Use video to explain concepts and show how things work.
- Are designed to be used in around 7 minutes or less.

## About collections

Collections bring together related Quick Guides to help you see the bigger
picture. For example, you might use a collection to:

- Understand topics that are closely related to your core goal.
- Help you discover how to implement additional use cases adjacent to your goal.
- Find background information or explore concepts more deeply.

You might find the same Quick Guide in more than one collection. That's part of
the information design; for example, a topic about how to hide password text
could apply to both displaying text and handling user input.

Some Quick Guides aren't part of any collection.

## Refine what you see

You can refine the results you see by using the buttons provided in the
left-side navigation pane and by entering keywords into the search box at
the top of the results pane.

### Search by category

The buttons in this section of the left-side navigation offer prefilled search items
for various categories. For example, in user interface quick guides, the buttons
might provide quick search results for "Animation" or "Lists." You can see
the search keyword appear in the search box when you click a particular button.

### Filter by guide type

The buttons in this section of the left-side navigation apply filters to
the types of guides displayed. For example, if you want to view all the
collections, you can filter results by clicking the **Collections only**
button. Then, you can enter search keywords to further refine the results.

Note that you cannot combine results by clicking **Search by category** and
**Filter by guide type** buttons. For example, if you click **Collections only**
and then click **Animation** , the results show what you would see if
you had clicked only **Animation**; no filter is applied. Remember: you can
enter keywords in the search box to refine your filtered results.
