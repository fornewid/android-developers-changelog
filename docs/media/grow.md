# Grow your app

After implementing basic features for your media app, differentiate your app by adding premium features such as[`HDR video`](https://developer.android.com/media/grow/hdr-playback),[`HDR tonemapping - LUT`](https://developer.android.com/media/grow/hdr-lut), and[`spatial audio`](https://developer.android.com/media/grow/spatial-audio). Consider that you may need to gracefully fall back to standard behavior on lower-powered devices. On form factors like large screen devices, features like[`picture-in-picture`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture)can be helpful in driving higher engagement as users look to multi-task.
