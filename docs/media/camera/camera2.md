# Camera2 overview

<br />

**Note:** This page refers to the[Camera2](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary)package. Unless your app requires specific, low-level features from Camera2, we recommend using[CameraX](https://developer.android.com/camerax). Both CameraX and Camera2 support Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher.

<br />

Camera2 is the low-level Android camera package that replaces the deprecated[Camera](https://developer.android.com/training/camera-deprecated)class. Camera2 provides in-depth controls for complex use cases, but requires you to manage device-specific configurations. For more information, see the[Camera2 reference documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary).

For most developers, we recommend the[CameraX Jetpack library](https://developer.android.com/camerax). To help you decide which camera library to use, see[Choose a camera library](https://developer.android.com/training/camera/choose-camera-library).
