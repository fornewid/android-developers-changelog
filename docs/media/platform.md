# Platform APIs and behaviors

This section discusses media APIs and behaviors that are part of the platform.
| **Note:** For most media use-cases, we recommend using Jetpack libraries such as[Media3](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media3). Jetpack libraries offer a richer feature set, more frequent updates, solutions for dealing with backwards-compatibility and fragmentation, and more customizability.

- [Supported media formats](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/supported-formats): Learn about the media codecs, containers, formats, and network protocols supported by the Android platform.
- [Compatible media transcoding](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/transcoding): Learn about the platform's ability to automatically convert videos recorded in modern video formats when opened by an app that doesn't support the format.
- [MediaPlayer overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/mediaplayer): Learn about`MediaPlayer`, a platform API for audio and video playback.
- [Control amplitude with VolumeShaper](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/volumeshaper): Learn about using the`VolumeShaper`API to perform short automated volume transitions such as fades and ducking.
- [Handle changes in audio output](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/output): Learn about APIs for volume control and reacting to changes in the audio output device.
- [Improve audio playback](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/improve-audio-playback#improve-audio-playback): Learn about using`DEFAULT`and`BIT_PERFECT`APIs to configure mixer attributes over USB.
- [Share audio input](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/sharing-audio-input): Learn about capturing audio input from a mic or other input device.
- [MediaRecorder overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/mediarecorder): Learn about using the`MediaRecorder`API to record audio.
- [Capture video and audio playback](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/platform/av-capture): Learn about using the`MediaProjection`and`AudioPlaybackCapture`APIs to record video or audio playback from another app, respectively.
