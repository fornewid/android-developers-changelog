# Get started with camera and media on Android

Camera and media apps span a broad range of use cases, from capturing content to editing photos to sharing music with friends to scrolling through videos on social media. In this developer center, you'll find resources to help you create, extend, level up, and optimize your apps for these types of use cases and more.

Currently, you will find guidance for media playback and video editing in this section, but over time the Camera and media developer center will grow to incorporate content for in-app capture and other relevant use cases, best practices as you build multidevice experiences, and direct references to sample app code so you can see it all in action.

This section also provides guidance on how to add camera capabilities to your app, whether by firing off an intent to launch the user's favorite camera app, or by building full camera capabilities directly into your app.

## Build an app

To build audio or video playback features, we recommend using ExoPlayer from the Jetpack Media3 library.

To build media editing features, we recommend using Transformer from the Jetpack Media3 library.

## Extend your app's reach

Reach your users where they are by adding support for more form factors like large screens and Wear OS, Google Assistant, and Cast-enabled devices.

## Level up your app

Take your app from good, to better, to best by implementing premium media features like HDR and spatial audio. Then, drive higher engagement and revenue with multidevice integrations.

## Optimize for high quality

Ensure users have a great experience when using your app by testing and investing in performance and reliability.

## Add camera capabilities to your app

Enable your app to capture photos and videos, either by integrating your app with the user's preferred camera app, or by adding full camera capabilities directly into your app.
