# Access to Experiment with Gemini Nano Program Additional Terms of Service

| **Caution:** The experimental Google AI Edge SDK is deprecated. We recommend using the[ML Kit Prompt API](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/genai/prompt/android)to send custom prompts to Gemini Nano.

*Last modified: September 26th, 2024*

To participate and use Google products and services in the Access to Experiment with Gemini Nano Program and the other Google developer services that reference these terms (collectively, the "APIs" or "Services"), you must accept (1) the[Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)(the "API**Terms"** ), and (2) these**Access to Experiment with Gemini Nano Program** Additional Terms of Service (the "Additional**Terms"**). Terms that are not defined in these Additional Terms have the meanings given in the API Terms.

## Age Requirements

You must be 18 years of age or older to use the APIs. You also will not use the Services as part of a website, mobile application, or other service (collectively, "API**Clients"**) that is directed towards or is likely to be accessed by individuals under the age of 18.

## Use Restrictions

You may only use the Services for internal testing and development of your API Clients and Google may enforce rate limits. You may not use any Services for production use.

You may only access the Services (or make API Clients available to users) within the available regions. You will not circumvent any technical or geographical restrictions of the Services.

You may not use the Services to develop models or products that compete with the Services (e.g., Gemini Nano or AICore). You also may not attempt to extract or replicate the underlying models (e.g., parameter weights).

You will only use the Services directly or in connection with the development of your Android application, i.e., you will not use the Services (e.g., Gemini Nano) to power another application programming interface.

In addition to the "API[Prohibitions"](https://developers.google.com/terms#a_api_prohibitions)section in the API Terms, you must comply with our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy), which provides additional details about appropriate conduct when using the Services.

The Services include safety features to block harmful content, such as content that violates our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy). You may not attempt to bypass these protective measures or use content that violates the API Terms or these Additional Terms.

You may not use the Services in clinical practice, to provide medical advice, or in any manner that is overseen by or requires clearance or approval from a medical device regulatory agency.

## Use of Generated Content

Some of our Services may allow you to generate original content. Google won't claim ownership over that content. You acknowledge that Google may generate the same or similar content for others and that we reserve all rights to do so.

As required by the API Terms, you'll comply with applicable law in using generated content. Use discretion before relying on generated content, including[code](https://g.co/legal/generative-code). You're responsible for your use of generated content, and for the use of that content by anyone you share it with.

## Data Use for Services

The terms in this section apply solely to your use of Services.

When you use the Services, processing of the input data (i.e. prompts) and resulting model outputs happens fully on-device, and this data is not sent to Google servers.

The Services may contact Google servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes, updated models, and hardware accelerator compatibility information. The Services also send metrics about the performance and utilization of the Services by your application to Google. Google uses this metrics data to measure performance, debug, maintain, and improve the APIs, and detect misuse or abuse, as further described in our[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Disclaimers

**The Services use experimental technology and may sometimes provide inaccurate or offensive content that doesn't represent Google's views**.

**Use discretion before relying on, publishing, or otherwise using content provided by the Services**.

**Don't rely on the Services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional. Content does not constitute medical treatment or diagnosis**.
