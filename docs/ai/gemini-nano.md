Gemini Nano lets you deliver rich generative AI experiences without needing
a network connection or sending data to the cloud. On-device AI is a great
solution for use-cases where low cost, and privacy safeguards are your primary
concerns.

For on-device use-cases, you can take advantage of Google's Gemini Nano
foundation model. [Gemini Nano runs in Android's AICore system service](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/a-new-foundation-for-ai-on-android.html),
which leverages device hardware to enable low inference latency and keeps the
model up-to-date.

Access to Gemini Nano is currently available through:

- [ML Kit GenAI APIs](https://developer.android.com/ai/gemini-nano/ml-kit-genai): Provides high-level interfaces for use-case-specific APIs, including summarization, proofreading, rewriting, image description, and speech recognition as well as the low-level Prompt API for flexibility.
