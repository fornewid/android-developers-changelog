## Background

Glamour is one of the main Condé Nast traditional brands. Every year, Glamour hosts a successful shopping event called[*GLAMOUR Shopping-Week*](https://www.glamourshopping.de/event/shopping-week)in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. This event has always been print-focused, as readers received a shopping card with the magazine to redeem discounts in selected shops, both offline and online, for one week.

In March 2016, Glamour digitized this experience.

## What they did

To make the most of*GLAMOUR Shopping-Week* , Condé Nast relaunched the[GLAMOUR app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.glamour.android&e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign)with a more appealing design and an improved user experience:

- The main features updated for the shopping week included a shop finder, online offers, and a digital shopping card.
- The current e-paper magazine was made available through the app and sold via Google Play Billing.
- They offered readers the in-app purchase of digital shopping cards and activation codes through Google Play Billing. Readers can activate digital shopping cards via in-app purchases or with the print shopping card activation code.
- The online and offline shopping experience was also supported by online shopping discount codes in the app or offline through the shop finder.

## Results

The offline and online combination resulted in positive engagement both in terms of app installs and sales:

- There were 130,000 new app downloads.
- **Sessions increased by 140%** compared to previous weeks. Session length doubled and**the number of active users grew by five times**.
- 12,000 in-app purchases were generated, increasing general e-paper sales by six times, which resulted in**an increase in total magazine circulation**.
- The digital shopping card was shown more than 200,000 times to redeem offers in shops.
