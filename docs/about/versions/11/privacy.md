## Get started with privacy updates

1. **Review the privacy features:** Assess your app. Look for how your app[stores files and user data](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage),[requests permissions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/permissions),[requests location](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/location). In addition, look for ways that your app[interacts with other apps](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/package-visibility), consider[performing an audit](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/data-access-auditing)of the data that your app accesses, and determine whether your app needs to update how it uses[foreground services](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/foreground-services).
2. **Test your app on Android 11:** Run your app on Android 11. Use[app compatibility tools](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-compatibility/test-debug)to evaluate how individual system changes affect your app.
3. **Update your app:**Targeting Android 11 if possible, test with users and publish an update.
