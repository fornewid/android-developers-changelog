If you use native code in your app, you should rebuild your app with support for 16 KB devices, and all developers should test their apps using a 16 KB environment to verify that there are no unexpected regressions in app behavior.                                                                                                                                            |

Because apps in the private space have restricted visibility, some types of apps need to take additional steps to be able to see and interact with apps in a user's private space. |

| User experience and system UI    | Change (apps targeting 15+) | [`TextView`width changes for complex letter shapes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#textview-width) In previous versions of Android, some cursive fonts or languages that have complex shaping might draw the letters in the previous or next character's area. In some cases, such letters were clipped at the beginning or ending position. Starting in Android 15, a`TextView`allocates width for drawing enough space for such letters and allows apps to request extra paddings to the left to prevent clipping.                                                                 |
