Applying an OTA image can help you recover a device that received an OTA update
for an Android 17 DP build but wouldn't start up
after the update was installed. If you are trying to get Android 17 on your
device but you aren't trying to recover from a failed OTA update, see [Get
Android 17](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/get) instead.

OTA images are available for the following Pixel devices:

- Pixel 6
- Pixel 6 Pro
- Pixel 6a
- Pixel 7
- Pixel 7 Pro
- Pixel 7a
- Pixel Tablet
- Pixel Fold
- Pixel 8
- Pixel 8 Pro
- Pixel 8a
- Pixel 9
- Pixel 9 Pro
- Pixel 9 Pro XL
- Pixel 9 Pro Fold
- Pixel 9a
- Pixel 10
- Pixel 10 Pro
- Pixel 10 Pro XL
- Pixel 10 Pro Fold

After you've installed a Developer Preview build to your Pixel device, you'll automatically be offered over-the-air (OTA) updates of later preview builds.

We also deliver flashable images at each milestone, so you can choose the
approach that works best for your test environment.

Use the following links and instructions to update your supported device to the
latest build. See [Get Android 17](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/get) for
other ways to get Android 17 for testing and development.

## Apply an OTA image

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/lockups/android-stacked.svg)

Download an OTA device image from the following table and apply it by following
the [updating instructions](https://developers.google.com/android/ota#instructions) listed on [Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel
Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/ota).

You can choose to [return to the latest public build](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/download-ota#public) at any time.

<br />

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Before applying an Android 17 OTA image, we strongly recommend that you [unlock the bootloader](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/bootloader/locking_unlocking) on your device if possible. Unlocking the bootloader requires a full device reset that removes all user data on the device, so make sure to back up your data first.

## Return to a public build

You can either use the Android Flash Tool to
[flash the factory image](https://flash.android.com/back-to-public), or obtain a factory spec system
image from the [Factory Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/images)
page and then manually flash it to the device.

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Going back to a public build from a preview build (Developer Preview or Beta) requires a full device reset that removes all user data on the device. Make sure to [back up your data first](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7179901).
