Applying an OTA image can help you recover a device that received an OTA update
for an Android 17 Beta build but wouldn't start up
after the update was installed. If you are trying to get Android 17 on your
device but you aren't trying to recover from a failed OTA update, see [Get
Android 17](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/get) instead.
Building on the [initial release of Android 17](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17), we continue to update the platform with fixes and improvements that are then rolled out to supported devices. These releases happen on a quarterly cadence through *Quarterly Platform Releases* (QPRs), which are delivered both to AOSP and to Google Pixel devices as part of *Feature Drops* .

<br />

Although QPR3 doesn't include API changes, we provide images of the latest QPR
beta builds so you can test your app with these releases as needed to help make
sure that these updates work as expected for all of your users.

To find OTA images for already-released, stable versions of the platform, see
[Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/ota).

Applying an OTA image can help you recover a device that received an OTA update
for an Android 17 QPR beta build but wouldn't start up after the update was
installed. If you are trying to get Android 17 QPR1 on your device but
you aren't trying to recover from a failed OTA update, see [Get Android 17 QPR
beta builds](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/qpr3/get) instead.


OTA images are available for the following Pixel devices:

- Pixel 6a
- Pixel 7
- Pixel 7 Pro
- Pixel 7a
- Pixel Tablet
- Pixel Fold
- Pixel 8
- Pixel 8 Pro

After you've installed a beta build to your Pixel device, your device is automatically enrolled in the [Android Beta for Pixel program](https://g.co/androidbeta) and offered continuous over-the-air (OTA) updates to the latest beta builds (including QPRs) until you choose to unenroll that device from the program.

We also deliver flashable images at each milestone, so you can choose the
approach that works best for your test environment.

Use the following links and instructions to update your supported device to the
latest build. See [Get Android 17](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/get) for
other ways to get Android 17 for testing and development.

## Apply an OTA image

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/lockups/android-stacked.svg)

Download an OTA device image from the following table and apply it by following
the [updating instructions](https://developers.google.com/android/ota#instructions) listed on [Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel
Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/ota).

You can choose to [return to the latest public build](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/qpr3/download-ota#public) at any time.

<br />

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Before applying an Android 17 OTA image, we strongly recommend that you [unlock the bootloader](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/bootloader/locking_unlocking) on your device if possible. Unlocking the bootloader requires a full device reset that removes all user data on the device, so make sure to back up your data first.

## Return to a public build

You can either use the Android Flash Tool to
[flash the factory image](https://flash.android.com/back-to-public), or obtain a factory spec system
image from the [Factory Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/images)
page and then manually flash it to the device.

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** Going back to a public build from a preview build (Developer Preview or Beta) requires a full device reset that removes all user data on the device. Make sure to [back up your data first](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7179901).
