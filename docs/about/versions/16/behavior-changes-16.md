<br />

Like previous releases, Android 16 includes behavior changes that might affect
your app. The following behavior changes apply exclusively to apps that are
targeting Android 16 or higher. If your app is targeting Android 16 or higher,
you should modify your app to support these behaviors, where applicable.

Be sure to also review the list of [behavior changes that affect all apps
running on Android 16](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all) regardless of your app's [`targetSdkVersion`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#target).

## User experience and system UI

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following changes that are intended
to create a more consistent, intuitive user experience.

### Edge to edge opt-out going away

[Android 15 enforced edge-to-edge](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#edge-to-edge) for apps targeting Android 15 (API
level 35), but your app could opt-out by setting
[`R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement) to `true`. For apps
targeting Android 16 (API level 36),
`R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` is deprecated and disabled, and your
app can't opt-out of going edge-to-edge.

- If your app targets Android 16 (API level 36) and is running on an Android 15 device, `R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` continues to work.
- If your app targets Android 16 (API level 36) and is running on an Android 16 device, `R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` is disabled.

For testing in Android 16, ensure your app supports edge-to-edge and
remove any use of `R.attr#windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` so that your app
also supports edge-to-edge on an Android 15 device. To support edge-to-edge,
see the [Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/insets) and [Views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/edge-to-edge) guidance.

### Migration or opt-out required for predictive back

For apps targeting Android 16 (API level 36) or higher and running on an
Android 16 or higher device, the predictive back system animations
(back-to-home, cross-task, and cross-activity) are enabled by default.
Additionally, `onBackPressed` is not called and
[`KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#KEYCODE_BACK) is not dispatched anymore.

If your app intercepts the back event and you haven't migrated to predictive
back yet, [update your app to use supported back navigation APIs](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/custom-back/predictive-back-gesture#update-custom), or
temporarily opt out by setting the
[`android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#enableOnBackInvokedCallback) attribute to `false` in the
`<application>` or `<activity>` tag of your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
The predictive back-to-home animation. The predictive cross-activity animation. The predictive cross-task animation.

### Elegant font APIs deprecated and disabled

Apps targeting Android 15 (API level 35) have the
[`elegantTextHeight`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#elegantTextHeight)
[`TextView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView) attribute set to `true` by
default, replacing the compact font with one that is much more readable. You
could override this by setting the `elegantTextHeight` attribute to `false`.

Android 16 deprecates the
[`elegantTextHeight`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#elegantTextHeight) attribute,
and the attribute will be ignored once your app targets Android 16. The "UI
fonts" controlled by these APIs are being discontinued, so you should adapt any
layouts to ensure consistent and future proof text rendering in Arabic, Lao,
Myanmar, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Telugu or Thai.
![](https://developer.android.com/static/about/versions/15/images/elegant-text-height-before.png) `elegantTextHeight` behavior for apps targeting Android 14 (API level 34) and lower, or for apps targeting Android 15 (API level 35) that overrode the default by setting the `elegantTextHeight` attribute to `false`. ![](https://developer.android.com/static/about/versions/15/images/elegant-text-height-after.png) `elegantTextHeight` behavior for apps targeting Android 16 (API level 36), or for apps targeting Android 15 (API level 35) that didn't override the default by setting the `elegantTextHeight` attribute to `false`.

## Core functionality

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following changes that modify or
expand various core capabilities of the Android system.

### Fixed rate work scheduling optimization

Prior to targeting Android 16, when [`scheduleAtFixedRate`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleAtFixedRate(java.lang.Runnable,%20long,%20long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
missed a task execution due to being outside a valid
[process lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle), **all** missed executions immediately
execute when the app returns to a valid lifecycle.

When targeting Android 16, at most **one** missed execution of
[`scheduleAtFixedRate`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleAtFixedRate(java.lang.Runnable,%20long,%20long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)) is immediately executed when the app
returns to a valid lifecycle. This behavior change is expected to improve app
performance. Test this behavior in your app to check if your app is impacted.
You can also test by using the [app compatibility framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-compatibility/test-debug)
and enabling the `STPE_SKIP_MULTIPLE_MISSED_PERIODIC_TASKS` compat flag.

## Device form factors

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following changes for apps when
displayed on large screen devices.

### Adaptive layouts

With Android apps now running on a variety of devices (such as phones, tablets,
foldables, desktops, cars, and TVs) and windowing modes on large screens (such
as split screen and desktop windowing), developers should build Android apps
that adapt to any screen and window size, regardless of device orientation.
Paradigms like restricting orientation and resizability are too restrictive in
today's multidevice world.

#### Ignore orientation, resizability, and aspect ratio restrictions

For apps targeting Android 16 (API level 36), orientation, resizability,
and aspect ratio restrictions no longer apply on displays with smallest width \>=
600dp. Apps fill the entire display window, regardless of aspect ratio or a
user's preferred orientation, and pillarboxing isn't used.

This change introduces a new standard platform behavior. [Android is moving
toward a model](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/orientation-and-resizability-changes-in-android-16.html) where apps are expected to adapt to various
orientations, display sizes, and aspect ratios. Restrictions like fixed
orientation or limited resizability hinder app adaptability. [Make your app
adaptive](https://developer.android.com/adaptive-apps) to deliver the best possible user experience.

You can also test this behavior by using the
[app compatibility framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-compatibility/test-debug) and enabling the
`UNIVERSAL_RESIZABLE_BY_DEFAULT` compat flag.

#### Common breaking changes

Ignoring orientation, resizability, and aspect ratio restrictions might impact
your app's UI on some devices, especially elements that were designed for small
layouts locked in portrait orientation: for example, issues like stretched
layouts and off-screen animations and components. Any assumptions about aspect
ratio or orientation can cause visual issues with your app.
[Learn more](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive) about how to avoid them and improve your app's adaptive
behaviour.

Allowing device rotation results in more activity re-creation, which can result
in losing user state if not properly preserved. Learn how to correctly save UI
state in [Save UI states](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/saving-states).

#### Implementation details

The following manifest attributes and runtime APIs are ignored across large
screen devices in full-screen and multi-window modes:

- [`screenOrientation`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#screen)
- [`resizableActivity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#resizeableActivity)
- [`minAspectRatio`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#minaspectratio)
- [`maxAspectRatio`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#maxaspectratio)
- [`setRequestedOrientation()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#setRequestedOrientation(int))
- [`getRequestedOrientation()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#getRequestedOrientation())

The following values for `screenOrientation`, `setRequestedOrientation()`, and
`getRequestedOrientation()` are ignored:

- `portrait`
- `reversePortrait`
- `sensorPortrait`
- `userPortrait`
- `landscape`
- `reverseLandscape`
- `sensorLandscape`
- `userLandscape`

Regarding display resizability, `android:resizeableActivity="false"`,
`android:minAspectRatio`, and `android:maxAspectRatio` have no effect.

For apps targeting Android 16 (API level 36), app orientation,
resizability, and aspect ratio constraints are ignored on large screens by
default, but every app that isn't fully ready can temporarily override this
behavior by opting out (which results in the previous behavior of being placed
in compatibility mode).

#### Exceptions

The Android 16 orientation, resizability, and aspect ratio restrictions don't
apply in the following situations:

- Games (based on the [`android:appCategory`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#appCategory) flag)
- Users explicitly opting in to the app's default behavior in aspect ratio settings of the device
- Screens that are smaller than `sw600dp`

#### Opt out temporarily

To opt out a specific activity, declare the
`PROPERTY_COMPAT_ALLOW_RESTRICTED_RESIZABILITY` manifest property:

    <activity ...>
      <property android:name="android.window.PROPERTY_COMPAT_ALLOW_RESTRICTED_RESIZABILITY" android:value="true" />
      ...
    </activity>

If too many parts of your app aren't ready for Android 16, you can opt out
completely by applying the same property at the application level:

    <application ...>
      <property android:name="android.window.PROPERTY_COMPAT_ALLOW_RESTRICTED_RESIZABILITY" android:value="true" />
    </application>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** The opt-out is temporary and won't apply when targeting API level 37 in a future Android release. That is, for apps targeting API level 37, orientation, resizability, and aspect ratio restrictions are ignored on displays that are at least `sw600dp`.

## Health and fitness

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following changes related to health
and fitness data.

### Health and fitness permissions

For apps targeting Android 16 (API level 36) or higher,
[`BODY_SENSORS`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#BODY_SENSORS) permissions use more granular permissions
under `android.permissions.health`, which [Health Connect](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect)
also uses. As of Android 16, any API previously requiring `BODY_SENSORS`
or `BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND` requires the corresponding
`android.permissions.health` permission instead. This affects the following data
types, APIs, and foreground service types:

- [`HEART_RATE_BPM`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/health/services/client/data/DataType#HEART_RATE_BPM()) from Health Services on Wear OS
- [`Sensor.TYPE_HEART_RATE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor#TYPE_HEART_RATE) from Android Sensor Manager
- [`heartRateAccuracy`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/protolayout/expression/PlatformHealthSources#heartRateAccuracy()) and [`heartRateBpm`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/protolayout/expression/PlatformHealthSources#heartRateBpm()) from `ProtoLayout` on Wear OS
- [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_HEALTH`](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/service-types#health) where the respective `android.permission.health` permission is needed in place of `BODY_SENSORS`

If your app uses these APIs, it should request the respective granular
permissions:

- For while-in-use monitoring of Heart Rate, SpO2, or Skin Temperature: request the granular permission under `android.permissions.health`, such as [`READ_HEART_RATE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/health/connect/HealthPermissions#READ_HEART_RATE) instead of [`BODY_SENSORS`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#BODY_SENSORS).
- For background sensor access: request [`READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/health/connect/HealthPermissions#READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND) instead of [`BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND).

These permissions are the same as those that guard access to reading data from
[Health Connect](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect), the Android datastore for health,
fitness, and wellness data.

#### Mobile apps

Mobile apps migrating to use the `READ_HEART_RATE` and other granular
permissions must also [declare an activity](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/develop/get-started#show-privacy-policy) to display
the app's privacy policy. This is the same requirement as Health Connect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** Failure to provide the rationale for mobile apps will result in the permission being revoked.

## Connectivity

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following changes in Bluetooth stack
to improve connectivity with peripheral devices.

### New intents to handle bond loss and encryption changes

As part of the [Improved bond loss handling](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#improved-bond-loss-handling), Android 16 also
introduces 2 new intents to provide apps with greater awareness of bond loss and
encryption changes.

Apps targeting Android 16 can now:

- Receive an [`ACTION_KEY_MISSING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_KEY_MISSING) intent when remote bond loss is detected, allowing them to provide more informative user feedback and take appropriate actions.
- Receive an [`ACTION_ENCRYPTION_CHANGE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_ENCRYPTION_CHANGE) intent whenever encryption status of the link changes. This includes encryption status change, encryption algorithm change, and encryption key size change. Apps must consider the bond restored if the link is successfully encrypted upon receiving [`ACTION_ENCRYPTION_CHANGE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_ENCRYPTION_CHANGE) intent later.

#### Adapting to varying OEM implementations

While Android 16 introduces these new intents, their implementation and
broadcasting can vary across different device manufacturers (OEMs). To ensure
your app provides a consistent and reliable experience across all devices,
developers should design their bond loss handling to gracefully adapt to these
potential variations.

We recommend the following app behaviors:

- If the [`ACTION_KEY_MISSING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_KEY_MISSING) intent is broadcast:

  The ACL (Asynchronous Connection-Less) link will be disconnected by the
  system, but the bond information for the device will be retained (as
  described [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/behavior-changes-all#improved-bond-loss-handling)).

  Your app should use this intent as the primary signal for bond loss
  detection and guiding the user to confirm the remote device is in range
  before initiating device forgetting or re-pairing.

  If a device disconnects after [`ACTION_KEY_MISSING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_KEY_MISSING) is received,
  your app should be cautious about reconnecting, as the device may no longer
  be bonded with the system.
- If the [`ACTION_KEY_MISSING`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_KEY_MISSING) intent is NOT broadcast:

  The ACL link will remain connected, and the bond information for the device
  will be removed by the system, same to behavior in Android 15.

  In this scenario, your app should continue its existing bond loss handling
  mechanisms as in previous Android releases, to detect and manage bond loss
  events.

### New way to remove bluetooth bond

All apps targeting Android 16 are now able to unpair bluetooth devices using a
public API in [`CompanionDeviceManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/companion/CompanionDeviceManager). If a companion device is
being managed as a CDM association, then the app can trigger
bluetooth bond removal by using the new [`removeBond(int)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/companion/CompanionDeviceManager#removeBond(int)) API
on the associated device. The app can monitor the bond state changes by
listening to the bluetooth device broadcast event
[`ACTION_BOND_STATE_CHANGED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#ACTION_BOND_STATE_CHANGED).

## Security

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following security changes.

### MediaStore version lockdown

For apps targeting Android 16 or higher, [`MediaStore#getVersion()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore#getVersion(android.content.Context)) will now
be unique to each app. This eliminates identifying properties from the version
string to prevent abuse and usage for fingerprinting techniques. Apps shouldn't
make any assumptions around the format of this version. Apps should already
handle version changes when using this API and in most cases shouldn't need to
change their current behavior, unless the developer has attempted to infer
additional information that is beyond the intended scope of this API.

### Safer Intents

The Safer Intents feature is a multi-phase security initiative designed to
improve the security of Android's intent resolution mechanism.
The goal is to protect apps from malicious actions by adding checks during
intent processing and filtering intents that don't meet specific criteria.

In [Android 15](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#safer-intents) the feature focused on the sending app, now with Android 16,
shifts control to the receiving app, allowing developers to opt-in to strict
intent resolution using their app manifest.

Two key changes are being implemented:

1. Explicit Intents Must Match the Target Component's Intent Filter:
   If an intent explicitly targets a component, it should match that component's
   intent filter.

2. Intents Without an Action Cannot Match any Intent Filter: Intents that
   don't have an action specified shouldn't be resolved to any intent filter.

These changes only apply when multiple apps are involved and don't affect
intent handling within a single app.

#### Impact

The opt-in nature means that developers must explicitly enable it in their
app manifest for it to take effect.
As a result, the feature's impact will be limited to apps whose developers:

- Are aware of the Safer Intents feature and its benefits.
- Actively choose to incorporate stricter intent handling practices into their apps.

This opt-in approach minimizes the risk of breaking existing apps that may rely
on the current less-secure intent resolution behavior.

While the initial impact in Android 16 may be limited, the Safer Intents
initiative has a roadmap for broader impact in future Android releases.
The plan is to eventually make strict intent resolution the default behavior.

The Safer Intents feature has the potential to significantly enhance the
security of the Android ecosystem by making it more difficult for
malicious apps to exploit vulnerabilities in the intent resolution mechanism.

However, the transition to opt-out and mandatory enforcement must be
carefully managed to address potential compatibility issues with existing apps.

#### Implementation

Developers need to explicitly enable stricter intent matching using the
`intentMatchingFlags` attribute in their app manifest.
Here is an example where the feature is opt-in for the entire app,
but disabled/opt-out on a receiver:

    <application android:intentMatchingFlags="enforceIntentFilter">
        <receiver android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="true" android:intentMatchingFlags="none">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.example.MY_CUSTOM_ACTION" />
            </intent-filter>
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.example.MY_ANOTHER_CUSTOM_ACTION" />
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>
    </application>

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The attribute can be specified on the `<application>` tag as well as at the component tags such as `<activity>`, `<activity-alias>`, `<receiver>`, `<service>`, `<provider>` and the attribute on the component can be used to override what's on the `<application>` tag

More on the supported flags:

| Flag Name | Description |
|---|---|
| enforceIntentFilter | Enforces stricter matching for incoming intents |
| none | Disables all special matching rules for incoming intents. When specifying multiple flags, conflicting values are resolved by giving precedence to the "none" flag |
| allowNullAction | Relaxes the matching rules to allow intents without an action to match. This flag to be used in conjunction with "enforceIntentFilter" to achieve a specific behavior |

#### Testing and Debugging

When the enforcement is active, apps should function correctly if the intent
caller has properly populated the intent.
However, blocked intents will trigger warning log messages like
`"Intent does not match component's intent filter:"` and `"Access blocked:"`
with the tag `"PackageManager."`
This indicates a potential issue that could impact the app and requires
attention.

Logcat filter:

    tag=:PackageManager & (message:"Intent does not match component's intent filter:" | message: "Access blocked:")

### GPU syscall filtering

To harden the Mali GPU surface, Mali GPU IOCTLs that have been deprecated or are
intended solely for GPU development have been blocked in production builds.
Additionally, IOCTLs used for GPU profiling have been restricted to the shell
process or debuggable applications. Refer to the SAC update for more details on
the platform-level policy.

This change takes place on Pixel devices using the Mali GPU (Pixel 6-9). Arm
has provided official categorization of their IOCTLs in
`Documentation/ioctl-categories.rst` of their [r54p2 release](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/dynamic-sections/changes/16/%22https:/developer.arm.com/downloads/-/Mali%205th%20Gen%20GPU%20Architecture#%22). This
list will continue to be maintained in future driver releases.

This change does not impact supported graphics APIs (including Vulkan and
OpenGL), and is not expected to impact developers or existing applications.
GPU profiling tools such as the Streamline Performance Analyzer and the Android
GPU Inspector won't be affected.

#### Testing

If you see a SELinux denial similar to the following, it is likely your
application has been impacted by this change:

    06-30 10:47:18.617 20360 20360 W roidJUnitRunner: type=1400 audit(0.0:85): avc:  denied  { ioctl }
    for  path="/dev/mali0" dev="tmpfs" ino=1188 ioctlcmd=0x8023
    scontext=u:r:untrusted_app_25:s0:c512,c768 tcontext=u:object_r:gpu_device:s0 tclass=chr_file
    permissive=0 app=com.google.android.selinux.pts

If your application needs to use blocked IOCTLs, please file a bug and assign it
to android-partner-security@google.com.

#### FAQ

1. **Does this policy change apply to all OEMs?**
   This change will be opt-in, but available to any OEMs who would like to use this
   hardening method. Instructions for implementing the change can be found in the
   implementation documentation.

2. **Is it mandatory to make changes in the OEM codebase to implement this, or does it come with a new AOSP release by default?**
   The platform-level change will come with a new AOSP release by default. Vendors
   may opt-in to this change in their codebase if they would like to apply it.

3. **Are SoCs responsible for keeping the IOCTL list up to date? For example, if my device uses an ARM Mali GPU, would I need to reach out to ARM for any of the changes?**
   Individual SoCs must update their IOCTL lists per device upon driver release.
   For example, ARM will update their published IOCTL list upon driver updates.
   However, OEMs should make sure that they incorporate the updates in their
   SEPolicy, and add any selected custom IOCTLs to the lists as needed.

4. **Does this change apply to all Pixel in-market devices automatically, or is a user action required to toggle something to apply this change?**
   This change applies to all Pixel in-market devices using the Mali GPU
   (Pixel 6-9). No user action is required to apply this change.

5. **Will use of this policy impact the performance of the kernel driver?**
   This policy was tested on the Mali GPU using GFXBench, and no measurable change
   to GPU performance was observed.

6. **Is it necessary for the IOCTL list to align with the current userspace and kernel driver versions?**
   Yes, the list of allowed IOCTLs must be synchronized with the IOCTLs supported
   by both the userspace and kernel drivers. If the IOCTLs in the user space or
   kernel driver are updated, the SEPolicy IOCTL list must be updated to match.

7. **ARM has categorized IOCTLs as 'restricted' / 'instrumentation', but we want to use some of them in production use-cases, and/or deny others.**
   Individual OEMs/SoCs are responsible for deciding on how to categorize the
   IOCTLs they use, based on the configuration of their userspace Mali libraries.
   ARM's list can be used to help decide on these, but each OEM/SoC's use-case may
   be different.

## Privacy

Android 16 (API level 36) includes the following privacy changes.

### Local Network Permission

Devices on the LAN can be accessed by any app that has the `INTERNET` permission.
This makes it easy for apps to connect to local devices but it also has privacy
implications such as forming a fingerprint of the user, and being a proxy for
location.

The Local Network Protections project aims to protect the user's privacy by
gating access to the local network behind a new runtime permission.

#### Release plan

This change will be deployed between two releases, **25Q2 and 26Q2**
respectively.
It is imperative that developers follow this guidance for **25Q2** and share
feedback because these protections **will be enforced at a later Android release**.
Moreover, they will need to update scenarios which depend on implicit local
network access by using the following guidance and prepare for user rejection
and revocation of the new permission.

#### Impact

At the current stage, LNP is an opt-in feature which means only the apps that
opt in will be affected. The goal of the opt-in phase is for app developers to
understand which parts of their app depend on implicit local network access
such that they can prepare to permission guard them for the next release.

Apps will be affected if they access the user's local network using:

- Direct or library use of raw sockets on local network addresses (e.g. mDNS or SSDP service discovery protocol)
- Use of framework level classes that access the local network (e.g. NsdManager)

Traffic **to** and **from** a local network address requires local network
access permission. The following table lists some common cases:

| App Low Level Network Operation | Local Network Permission Required |
|---|---|
| Making an outgoing TCP connection | yes |
| Accepting incoming TCP connections | yes |
| Sending a UDP unicast, multicast, broadcast | yes |
| Receiving an incoming UDP unicast, multicast, broadcast | yes |

These restrictions are implemented deep in the networking stack,
and thus they apply to **all networking APIs**. This includes sockets created
in native or managed code, networking libraries like Cronet and OkHttp,
and any APIs implemented on top of those. Trying to resolve services on the
local network (i.e. those with a .local suffix) will require local network
permission.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Traffic originating from Android Webviews that require local network access will inherit permission state from the host app

Exceptions to the rules above:

- If a device's DNS server is on a local network, traffic to or from it (at port 53) doesn't require local network access permission.
- Applications using Output Switcher as their in-app picker won't need local network permissions (more guidance to come in 2025Q4).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Many media casting scenarios depend on access to the local network and will be impacted by this change. However, not all apps which offer casting will need to request the new permission. Future APIs and guidance for dealing with casting scenarios will be provided in 25Q4.

#### Developer Guidance (Opt-in)

To opt into local network restrictions, do the following:

1. Flash the device to a build with 25Q2 Beta 3 or later.
2. Install the app to be tested.
3. Toggle the Appcompat flag in adb:

       adb shell am compat enable RESTRICT_LOCAL_NETWORK <package_name>

4. **Reboot The device**

Now your app's access to the local network is restricted and any attempt to
access the local network will lead to socket errors. If you are using APIs that
perform local network operations outside of your app process (ex: NsdManager),
**they won't be impacted during the opt-in phase.**

To restore access, you must grant your app permission to `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`.

1. Ensure the app declares the `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` permission in its manifest.
2. Go to **Settings \> Apps \> \[Application Name\] \> Permissions \> Nearby devices \>
   Allow**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** In a future Android release, this feature will be guarded by a *new* permission in the Nearby devices permission group

Now your app's access to the local network should be restored and all your
scenarios should work as they did prior to opting the app in.

Once enforcement for local network protection begins, here is how the app
network traffic will be impacted.

| Permission | Outbound LAN Request | Outbound/Inbound Internet Request | Inbound LAN Request |
|---|---|---|---|

Use the following command to toggle-off the App-Compat flag

    adb shell am compat disable RESTRICT_LOCAL_NETWORK <package_name>

#### Errors

Errors arising from these restrictions will be returned to the calling socket
whenever it invokes send or a send variant to a local network address.

Example errors:

    sendto failed: EPERM (Operation not permitted)

    sendto failed: ECONNABORTED (Operation not permitted)

#### Local Network Definition

A local network in this project refers to an IP network that utilizes a
broadcast-capable network interface, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet, but excludes
cellular (WWAN) or VPN connections.

The following are considered local networks:

**IPv4:**

- 169.254.0.0/16 // Link Local
- 100.64.0.0/10 // CGNAT
- 10.0.0.0/8 // RFC1918
- 172.16.0.0/12 // RFC1918
- 192.168.0.0/16 // RFC1918

**IPv6:**

- Link-local
- Directly-connected routes
- Stub networks like Thread
- Multiple-subnets (TBD)

Additionally, both multicast addresses (224.0.0.0/4, ff00::/8) and the IPv4
broadcast address (255.255.255.255) are classified as local network addresses.

### App-owned photos

When prompted for photo and video permissions by an app targeting SDK 36 or
higher on devices running Android 16 or higher, users who choose to limit access
to selected media will see any photos owned by the app pre-selected in the photo
picker. Users can deselect any of these pre-selected items, which will revoke
the app's access to those photos and videos.
