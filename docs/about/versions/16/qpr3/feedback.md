## Issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to create new issues and to view, track, and vote for issues that you and other developers have created.

### Create and vote for issues

Before creating your own issue, check the [release notes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/release-notes) and search the lists of [top open issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/top-issues) and [recently created issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/recent-issues) to see if someone else has already reported it.


You can subscribe and vote for an issue by **starring it**
![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/shared/star-issue.svg)
in the issue tracker. For more information, see
[Subscribing by starring an issue](https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker/guides/subscribe#subscribing_by_starring_an_issue). For general help with Google Issue Tracker, see the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker/).

Due to the volume of feedback, submitted issues from any channel might not receive a response and issues might be closed upon release of the next build. This process allows our teams to focus on issues that are still reproducible in the latest release.

If your feedback is closed and you're still experiencing the issue on the latest build, please check the [release notes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/release-notes) and the lists of [top open issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/top-issues) and [recently created issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/recent-issues) and **star** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/shared/star-issue.svg) the issue if it already exists. If not, please submit your feedback again.
