## About Android 16 Beta 4

Beta 4 is now available, with the latest changes to try with your apps. This
release is suitable for development, testing, and general use. While we're
closing in on the release of Android 16, it is still in active development, so
the Android system and apps running on it **might not always work as expected**.

Beta 4 also marks the second release since our [Platform Stability](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/overview#platform_stability)
milestone, which means that Android 16 has reached final internal and external
APIs and final app-facing behaviors. [Update your environment](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/setup-sdk) and start your
final [compatibility testing](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/migration#compat) now so you can publish any necessary
compatibility updates ahead of the final release.

As with previous versions, Android 16 includes system changes. In some cases,
these changes can affect apps until they are updated to support Android 16, so
you might see impacts ranging from minor issues to more significant limitations.
In general, most apps will work as expected, as will most APIs and features.

## How to get Beta 4

You can install this release on any of the following Google Pixel devices:

- Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
- Pixel 7 and 7 Pro
- Pixel 7a
- Pixel Fold
- Pixel Tablet
- Pixel 8 and 8 Pro
- Pixel 8a
- Pixel 9, 9a, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold

See [Get Android 16](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/get) for details on how to get started.

Remember to update your SDK and the Android Emulator as well before you try out
the latest features and changes. The best way to do this is using the SDK
Manager in the [latest preview version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview).

Depending on your development and testing needs, you can also get Android 16 in
the following ways:

- Get Android 16 [on a partner device](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/devices)
- Get Android 16 [on the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/get#on_emulator)
- Get a [Generic System Image](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/gsi-release-notes) (GSI)

### General advisories

Be aware of these general advisories about the release:

Apps that depend on CTS-approved builds or use [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) ([SafetyNet APIs are
  deprecated](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/safetynet/deprecation-timeline)) might not work normally on Android 16 Beta builds.

### Get support

Two primary support channels are available to you when developing and testing
with Android Beta. The channel you should use to get support depends on where
you are encountering your issue.

  apps** : Use the Issue Tracker to create new issues and to view and track issues that you and other developers have submitted. Before creating your own issue, check the known issues listed on this page and search the lists of [top
  open issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/top-issues) and [recently created issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/recent-issues) to see if someone else has already reported it. You can subscribe and vote for an issue by clicking **star this issue** . See [Where to report issues](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/feedback#templates) to find an issue template that best matches the type of issue that you are encountering.

### Android 16 Beta 1

[Beta 1 is now available](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/first-beta-android16.html),
with the latest features and changes to try with your apps. Beta 1 is also the
first Android 16 release for early adopters and Android enthusiasts who want to
try out what's coming in Android 16. This release is suitable for development,
testing, and general use. However, Android 16 is still in active development, so
the Android system and apps running on it **might not always work as expected**.

As with previous versions, Android 16 includes system changes. In some cases,
these changes can affect apps until they are updated to support Android 16, so
you might see impacts ranging from minor issues to more significant limitations.
In general, most apps will work as expected, as will most APIs and features, but
please review any [known issues listed on this page](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#ki-beta2) to get a better idea of
what to expect.
