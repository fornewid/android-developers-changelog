You can get Android 16 QPR1 in any of the following ways:

- [Get QPR1 on a Google Pixel device](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/get-qpr#on_pixel)
- [Get a generic system image (GSI)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/get-qpr#on_gsi)

## Get QPR1 on a Google Pixel device

The easiest way to get Android 16 QPR1 on a Pixel device is to [enroll your
device in the Android Beta for Pixel program](https://g.co/androidbeta).

Enrolling is a fast process, and it's highly recommended for developers and
early adopters. In most cases, you don't need to do a full reset of your data to
install an Android 16 QPR beta build, but it's recommended that you [back up
data](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7179901) before enrolling your device.

After you have enrolled, your device is offered continuous over-the-air (OTA)
updates to the latest beta builds (including QPRs) until you choose to unenroll
that device from the program.

Android 16 QPR1 is available for the following Pixel devices:

- Pixel 6 and 6 Pro
- Pixel 6a
- Pixel 7 and 7 Pro
- Pixel 7a
- Pixel Fold
- Pixel Tablet
- Pixel 8 and 8 Pro
- Pixel 8a
- Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold
- Pixel 9a

### Flash or manually install a system image

Alternatively, you can flash or manually install the latest Android 16 QPR beta
build on your Pixel device. The recommended way to flash Android 16 QPR to a
Pixel device is to use [Android Flash
Tool](https://flash.android.com/preview/baklava-qpr1-beta3.1).

If you'd rather flash your device manually, you can get a system image for your
device on the [Factory images for Google Pixel](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/download) page. See the general
instructions there for how to flash a system image to your device. This approach
can be useful when you need more control over testing, such as for automated
testing or regression testing.
| **Note:** After you've flashed a beta build to a supported Pixel device, your device is automatically enrolled in the [Android Beta for Pixel program](https://g.co/androidbeta) and offered continuous over-the-air (OTA) updates to the latest beta builds (including QPRs) until you choose to unenroll that device from the program.

## Get a generic system image (GSI)

Android [Generic System Image (GSI)](https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image) binaries are available to developers for
app testing and validation purposes on supported [Treble-compliant devices](https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image#device-compliance).
You can use these images to address any compatibility issues as well as discover
and report OS and framework issues.

See the [GSI documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/generic-system-image) for device requirements, flashing instructions,
and information on choosing the right image type for your device. Once you're
ready to download a GSI binary, see the [Downloads section](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/gsi-release-notes#downloads) on the GSI
binaries page.
