# Vulkan graphics API

The Android platform includes an Android-specific implementation of the[Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)API specification from the Khronos Group. Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API for high-performance, 3D graphics. It provides tools for creating high-quality, real-time graphics in applications. Vulkan also provides advantages such as reducing CPU overhead and providing support for the[SPIR-V Binary Intermediate language](https://www.khronos.org/spir).

This section begins with information on how to[get started](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/getting-started)using Vulkan in your Android app. Next, it provides useful information that you should know about[Vulkan design guidelines](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/design-notes)on the Android platform. From there, it explains how to use Vulkan's[shader compilers](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/shader-compilers). Last, it teaches you how to use[validation layers](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/graphics/validation-layer)to help assure stability in apps using Vulkan.

For more general information about this cross-platform API specification, see Khronos's[Vulkan Overview](http://khr.io/vulkanlaunchoverview). You can also keep up with the latest Vulkan-related developments at the Vulkan[news page](https://www.khronos.org/#slider_vulkan).
