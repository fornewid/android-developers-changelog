# Use existing libraries

This section discusses the use of the libraries that the NDK provides.
| **Note:** The guide on importing prebuilt libraries (those not included in the NDK) has been moved into the relevant sections for each build system. Refer to either the[CMake](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake#prebuilts)or[ndk-build](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/prebuilts)guides as appropriate for your project.

It explains the[C++ runtimes](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support)available with the NDK and provides information on[the other libraries](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/stable_apis)that the NDK provides, such as[OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/)and[OpenSL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opensles/), and the minimum Android API levels required to support those libraries.
