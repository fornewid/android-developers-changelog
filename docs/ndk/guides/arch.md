# Architectures and CPUs

When you're working with native code, hardware matters. The NDK lets you ensure you're compiling for the right architectures and CPUs by giving you a variety of ABIs from which to choose.

This section explains how to target specific[architectures and CPUs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis)at build time, how to use ARM[Neon extensions](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpu-arm-neon), and how the[CPU features](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpu-features)library lets you query optional features at run-time.
