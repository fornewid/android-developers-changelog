# Build your project

There are three main ways to build code with the NDK:

- The Make-based [ndk-build](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/ndk-build).
- [CMake](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake).
- [Standalone toolchains](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain) for integration with other build systems, or use with `configure`-based projects.
