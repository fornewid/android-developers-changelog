# Environment variables

You can configure the behavior of Android Studio and the command-line tools by setting environment variables. One of the most useful environment variables to set is[`ANDROID_HOME`](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables#android_home), which many tools read to determine the Android SDK installation directory. To run tools from the command line without including the full path to the executable, set your command search path environment variable to include<var translate="no">ANDROID_HOME</var>`/tools`,<var translate="no">ANDROID_HOME</var>`/tools/bin`, and<var translate="no">ANDROID_HOME</var>`/platform-tools`.

## How to set environment variables

The following examples show how to set environment variables in a terminal window and in a shell script for different operating systems. Variable settings in terminal windows last only as long as the window is open. On macOS and Linux, each time a new shell starts, variable settings are set in shell initialization scripts. On Windows, variable settings can be set through the system settings.

**Windows:**In a terminal window, type the following:  

```
set HTTP_PROXY=myserver:1981
```

Alternately, add it through the Windows UI. Check the documentation for your version of Windows to learn how.

**macOS and Linux:**The precise method of setting environment variables depends on which shell you are using. To determine which shell type is running, type the following:  

```
echo $0
```

In shells such as[Gnu Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)or[Zsh](https://zsh.org), variables are set using the following syntax:  

```
export VARIABLE_NAME=<new-value>
```

In other shells, such as[TCSH](https://www.tcsh.org/), variables are set using the following syntax:  

```
setenv VARIABLE_NAME <new-value>
```

These commands can be added to the shell initialization script to set the variables each time a new shell instance is run.

The location of the shell initialization script depends on the shell being used. For Gnu Bash, the location can be`~/.bash_profile`. For Zsh, the location can be`~/.zprofile`. For TCSH, the location can be`~/.cshrc`. Check the documentation for the shell that you're using to be sure.

You can also update the`PATH`environment variable to include the tool locations.

For Gnu Bash or Zsh:  

```
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
  
```

And for TCSH:  

```
setenv ANDROID_HOME ~/Library/Android/sdk
setenv PATH $PATH\:$ANDROID_HOME/tools\:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin\:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
  
```

| `ANDROID_HOME`                                          | Sets the path to the SDK installation directory. Once set, the value does not typically change and can be shared by multiple users on the same machine.`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, which also points to the SDK installation directory, is deprecated. If you continue to use it, Android Studio and the Android Gradle plugin will check that the old and new variables are consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `ANDROID_USER_HOME`                                     | Sets the path to the user preferences directory for tools that are part of the Android SDK. Defaults to`$HOME/.android/`. Some older tools, such as Android Studio 4.3 and earlier, do not read`ANDROID_USER_HOME`. To override the user preferences location for those older tools, set`ANDROID_SDK_HOME`to the parent directory you would like the`.android`directory to be created under.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If`STUDIO_GRADLE_JDK`is not defined, the IDE uses the value set in the[project structure settings](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects#ProjectStructure).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| By default, the emulator stores configuration files under`$HOME/.android/`and AVD data under`$HOME/.android/avd/`. You can override the defaults by setting the following environment variables. The`emulator -avd <avd_name>`command searches the`avd`directory in the order of the values in`$ANDROID_AVD_HOME`,`$ANDROID_USER_HOME/avd/`, and`$HOME/.android/avd/`. For emulator environment variable help, type`emulator -help-environment`at the command line.

| `ANDROID_EMULATOR_USE_SYSTEM_LIBS`                      | Contains a value of 0 (default) or 1. A value of 1 means the system's`libstdc++.so`file is used instead of the one that comes bundled with the emulator. Set this environment variable only when the emulator does not start on your Linux system because of a system library problem. For example, some Linux Radeon GL driver libraries require a more recent`libstdc++.so`file.**Note:**There is no guarantee that setting this environment variable to 1 will make the emulator runnable. It is a work-around for system library issues that affect a very small number of Linux users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `QEMU_AUDIO_DRV``QEMU_AUDIO_OUT_DRV``QEMU_AUDIO_IN_DRV` | On Linux, you can change the default audio backend of the emulator by setting the`QEMU_AUDIO_DRV`environment variable to one of the following values: - `alsa`: Use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) backend - `esd`: Use the Enlightened Sound Daemon (EsounD) backend - `sdl`: Use the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) audio backend (no audio input supported) - `oss:`: Use the Open Sound System (OSS) backend - `none:`: Do not support audio ``` set QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=alsa ``` You can also use distinct backends for audio input and audio outputs by selecting one of the QEMU values for the`QEMU_AUDIO_OUT_DRV`and`QEMU_AUDIO_IN_DRV`environment variables: ``` set QEMU_AUDIO_OUT=esd set QEMU_AUDIO_IN=oss ``` If you want to disable the audio support, use the`emulator -no-audio`option or set`QEMU_AUDIO_DRV`to`none`. You might need to disable the audio in the following situations: - In rare cases, audio drivers can cause Windows to reboot while the emulator is running. - On some Linux machines, the emulator might get stuck at startup with audio support enabled. |
| `ANDROID_SERIAL`                                        | Use this variable to provide an emulator serial number, such as emulator-5555, to an`adb`command. If you set this variable but use the`-s`option to specify a serial number from the command line, the command-line input overrides the value in`ANDROID_SERIAL`. The following example sets`ANDROID_SERIAL`and calls`adb install helloworld.apk`, which then installs the Android application package on emulator-5555. ``` set ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-555 adb install helloWorld.apk ```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
