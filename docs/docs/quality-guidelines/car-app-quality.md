To provide a great experience for users in cars, complete the car compatibility
checklists and tests that follow as you design and develop your app.

The checklists and tests define an extensive set of quality requirements for the
various app categories supported by Android Auto and Android Automotive OS. Many
requirements apply only to specific categories, so be sure to filter by your
app's category. See the [Car quality tiers](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/car-app-quality#car-quality-tiers) definitions for
details on which guidelines your app must meet in order to be accepted on the
Google Play Store.

> [!NOTE]
> **May 2025 Update** : Addition and removal of various criteria. See [May 2025](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/car-app-quality#may-25) for details.

## Test your app

Test your app for the applicable criteria listed on this page before submitting
your app to Google Play for review. As applicable, test both of the ways
users can access your app:

## Car quality tiers

The quality tiers define criteria to help you assess the level of support your
app provides for cars. Each category builds upon those below it. That is, for an
app to be *Car optimized* , it should also meet all of the applicable *Car ready*
requirements.

In addition to the guidelines specific to cars, each tier has associated
guidelines from the [Large screen app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality)
that are relevant for activities implemented by your app.

Levels of support include the following:

### Tier 3 - Car ready

Your app is large screen compatible and can be used while the car is parked.
While it may not have any car-optimized features, users can experience the app
just as they would on any other large screen Android-powered device.

This tier primarily applies to the
[parked categories](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/parked) of apps, which must meet all of the
requirements in this tier to be accepted on the Google Play Store.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Through the upcoming [Car ready mobile apps program](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/car-ready-mobile-apps), mobile apps meeting the requirements in this tier can be made available for use on Android Auto as well as for download from the Google Play Store on Android Automotive OS vehicles with Google built-in.

### Tier 2 - Car optimized

Your app provides a great experience on the car's center stack display. To
accomplish this, your app has some car-specific capabilities that users can
experience across driving or parked modes, depending on your app's category.

Apps in [categories built for use while driving](https://developer.android.com/training/cars#supported-app-categories)
must meet meet all of the applicable requirements in this tier to be accepted on
the Google Play Store.

### Tier 1 - Car differentiated

Your app is built to work across the variety of hardware in cars and can adapt
its experience across driving and parked modes. It provides the best user
experience designed for the different screens in cars such as the center console,
instrument cluster, and additional screens - like panoramic displays seen in
many premium cars.

## Frequently asked questions


**What happens after I submit my app?**


Apps for cars are subject to an additional manual review beyond normal Play
Store review processes. Your app is tested to ensure compliance against the
applicable criteria.


**After submitting my app, how will I find out if my app does not meet all
the requirements for Android Auto or Android Automotive OS?**


If your app does not meet the app quality requirements described on this page,
the Play Store team contacts you through the email address specified in the
[Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) account
associated with the app.


**Note:** For information about how to publish your app in Google Play, see [Distribute to cars](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/distribute).


**How do I manage policy violations and appeals?**


You can learn more about [managing policy violations and appeals](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9899142) in the Google Play policy center.


**My app targets more than just Android Auto or Android Automotive OS. If my app does not meet the
car requirements, will my new or updated app still appear on Google Play for other devices?**


No. When Google begins the approval process, your app undergoes an app quality
review. Any subsequent updates are not available for distribution until the
app is approved. If you need to make updates to your app for other devices,
consider creating a separate release from the updates to your car app.


**Important:** Due to this restriction, you should not use your production APK
for Android Auto support prototyping.
