Devices that can run Android apps come in a variety of form factors---ChromeOS (including its successor OS) devices (collectively, "ChromeOS devices"), phones, tablets, foldables---which have a wide range of screen sizes. Android supports multiple display modes, including multi-window, multi-display, multi-instance, and picture-in-picture. Foldable devices can be in various folded states, or postures, such as tabletop posture or book posture.

![Depiction of the three quality tiers as layers stacked vertically.](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/quality_guidelines_header.png)

To ensure your app provides a great user experience regardless of device form factor, screen size, display mode, or posture, complete the large screen compatibility [checklists](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/archive/adaptive/large-screen-app-quality#large_screen_checklists) and [tests](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/archive/adaptive/large-screen-app-quality#large_screen_compatibility_tests).

The checklists and tests define a comprehensive set of quality requirements for most types of Android apps. Your app probably won't need to meet all of the requirements. Implement the ones that make sense for your app's use cases.

As you enhance your app with large screen capabilities, help users better understand your app's large screen experience by updating your app listing on Google Play. Upload screenshots that show off the app on large screens. Call attention to large screen features in your app description. For more information and best practices, see [Google Play Help](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9866151).

For examples of optimized and differentiated large screen layouts, see the [large screen gallery](https://developer.android.com/large-screens/gallery).

## Large screen compatibility checklists

The compatibility checklists define criteria to help you assess the level of support your app provides for large screens.

Levels of support include the following:

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/tier-3/tier_3_icon.svg)

### TIER 3 (basic) --- Large screen ready

Users can complete critical task flows but with a less than optimal user experience. Your app runs full screen (or full window in multi-window mode), but app layout might not be ideal. The app is not letterboxed; it does not run in compatibility mode. The app provides basic support for external input devices, including keyboard, mouse, trackpad, and stylus.

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/tier-2/tier_2_icon.svg)

### TIER 2 (better) --- Large screen optimized

Your app implements layout optimizations for all screen sizes and device configurations along with enhanced support for external input devices.

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/tier-1/tier_1_icon.svg)

### TIER 1 (best) --- Large screen differentiated

Your app provides a user experience designed for tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS devices. Where applicable, the app supports multitasking, foldable postures, drag and drop, and stylus input.

Complete the Tier 2 requirements to enable your app to provide an excellent user experience on all Android devices. To make your app outstanding on large screens, complete Tier 1.

### Large screen optimized

Optimized apps fully support all screen types and device states, including state transitions.

| Category | ID | Test | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| UX | LS-U1 | [T2-1](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/archive/adaptive/large-screen-app-quality#T2-1) | App has responsive and adaptive layouts designed for large screens. All layouts are responsive (see [Migrate your UI to responsive layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/migrate-to-responsive-layouts)). Implementation of adaptive layouts is determined by [window size classes](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/window-size-classes). The app UI can include the following: - Leading‑edge navigation rails that expand on larger window sizes into full navigation panels - Grid layouts that scale the number of columns to accommodate window size changes - Columns of text on large screens - Trailing‑edge panels that are open by default on laptop and desktop screen sizes; closed, on smaller screens Create two-pane layouts, where appropriate, to take advantage of the large screen space. See [Canonical layouts](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/canonical-layouts). [Activity embedding](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/activity-embedding) enables activity-based apps to create multi‑pane layouts by displaying activities side by side. |
