## Guarantee reliability with automated testing

Automate testing with tools like the[Espresso testing framework](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso)and[Jetpack Compose testing APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/apis). Automated testing speeds up development by providing rapid feedback, eliminating errors caused by human intervention, and improving app stability through comprehensive testing. The result: lower development cost, better resource allocation, and faster release cycles to ultimately enhance the user experience with a more stable and reliable app.
