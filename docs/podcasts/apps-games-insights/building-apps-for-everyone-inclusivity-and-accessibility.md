# Building apps for everyone; inclusivity and accessibility

EP 6 \| 9 APR 2020

### Building apps for everyone; why inclusivity and accessibility truly matter

[\< Go back to episodes](http://developer.android.com/podcasts/apps-games-insights)Figuring out how to make your app or game accessible to all can be a challenge, both from an organizational and technical perspective. But with over 1 billion people around the world with some sort of disability, not rising to the challenge can exclude a significant audience from your app or game. This episode's guests, Rosalind Whittam and Ceri Lindsay from the BBC, share insights into how this public broadcaster has ensured accessibility and inclusivity permeate every aspect of the apps it uses to reach listeners and viewers outside traditional broadcast channels.
