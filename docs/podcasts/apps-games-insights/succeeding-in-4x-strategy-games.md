David Eckleberry, General Manager of the 4x strategy game Star Trek Fleet Command at Scopely, and Howard Chen, Developer Growth Consultant at Google Play, discuss the game genre, how the team at Scopely approached Star Trek Fleet Command, and how other game developers can find success in the genre -- or, in Star Trek lingo: how 4x strategy games can live long and prosper.
