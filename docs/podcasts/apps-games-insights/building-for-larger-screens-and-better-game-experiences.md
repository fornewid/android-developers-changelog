# Building for larger screens and better game experiences

EP 7 \| 16 APR 2020

### Building for larger screens and better game experiences

[\< Go back to episodes](http://developer.android.com/podcasts/apps-games-insights)The growth of Android and its application beyond smartphones means that apps and games are no longer constrained by the dimensions of a single pocketable screen: they can now run on devices that offer traditional laptop and desktop screen sizes. At the same time, in order to continue to engage with players regardless of the gaming platform, mature mobile game franchises are looking for opportunities beyond mobile for this.

This episode's guest is Maximiliano Rodriguez, Platforms Operations Director at Gameloft who discusses the challenges in taking games to larger screens or new platforms.
