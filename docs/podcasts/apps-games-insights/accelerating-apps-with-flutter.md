# Accelerating apps with Flutter

EP 16 \| 14 DEC 2020

However, we look at how Google's UI toolkit Flutter can help simplify things alongside creating beautiful apps. We're joined by Larry Mckenzie and Corey Sprague from eBay Motors, who discuss building new high-quality Android and iOS experiences for buying and selling vehicles on eBay, using Flutter to build attractive, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
