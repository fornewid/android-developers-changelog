# Winning as a subscription business

EP 8 \| 23 APR 2020

### Sign-up, sign-up, sign-up! How to win as a subscription business

[\< Go back to episodes](http://developer.android.com/podcasts/apps-games-insights)Between 2016 and 2018 developers using subscriptions saw earnings grow 4X. It is clear that subscriptions are an increasingly popular way for developers to monetize apps and games, and for users to access content and services. However, to be successful you have to find the right combination of offering and price. This episode's guests are Holly Ackerman and David Berlin from DAZN, who share insights about the challenges involved in setting up a subscription-based sports streaming service. DAZN is building the world's largest and fastest growing live sports streaming service. With the sport schedule disrupted, the global roll-out to more than 200 countries and territories is slated for later this summer.
