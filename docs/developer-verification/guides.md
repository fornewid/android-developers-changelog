Android developer verification is a new requirement designed to link real-world
entities (individuals and organizations) with their Android applications.
Starting in 2026, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified
developers in order to be installed by users on certified
[Android devices](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/). This guide shows what you need to do.

## Why these changes are happening

Android's developer verification adds a layer of security. This protects users
by deterring bad actors and making it harder for them to spread harm.

## How this helps you

A safer, more trusted ecosystem benefits the entire developer community.

- **Deters bad actors** who prefer to operate anonymously.
- **Makes it harder to spread harm** by linking bad apps to their developers. This helps us hold developers accountable, enforce safety policies, and remove malicious networks.
- **Boosts user confidence**, helping you build relationships with new users and establish trust.

## What you need to do

Complete these two steps:

1. **Verify your identity**: Provide information and documentation to confirm your identity as an individual or an organization.
2. **Register your package names**: Prove ownership of your apps and register them with your verified identity.

This guide walks you through each requirement.

## Timelines and milestones

The Android developer verification rollout happens in phases. This approach
allows us to incorporate your feedback and gives you time to prepare. Here's
what to focus on at each stage:

|---|---|---|
| Date | Milestone | Developer focus |
| August 2025 | New Android developer verification requirements [announced](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html) | Learn about the new requirements and sign up for early access. |
| November 2025 | Early access begins | If invited, start your identity verification and app registration. |
| March 2026 | Registration opens for all developers | Begin your identity verification and app registration for all apps you want to remain installable on certified Android devices. |
| September 2026 | Regional enforcement begins | Verify compliance to avoid installation blocks on your apps in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. |
| 2027 and beyond | Global enforcement | The rollout continues worldwide. |

## Key concepts

Before you start, review these key terms:

- **Identity verification**: The process of providing information and official documentation to verify your identity as an individual or organization.
- **Package name registration**: The process of creating a formal, verifiable link between your app's unique package name and signing keys.
- **App signing key** : The certificate used to [sign your APK](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).
- **Certified Android devices** : Google enforces Android developer verification requirements on these devices. If your app runs on a [certified device](https://www.android.com/certified/), these requirements apply to you, regardless of your app's download source.
- **Android Developer Console (ADC)**: A console for developers who distribute apps only outside of Google Play.
- **Google Play Console (PDC)**: The console for developers who distribute apps on Google Play. If you have a Play Console account, use it to complete the verification requirements.
