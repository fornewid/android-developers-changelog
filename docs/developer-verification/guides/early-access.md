Starting November 3, developers who [sign up for early access](https://goo.gle/android-verification-early-access) to Android
developer verification will start receiving invitations on a rolling basis,
when it's their turn to join.

We're sending out invitations to small groups of developers at a time, so we can
handle all your feedback, and use it to influence the product.

Participants will have several channels to share feedback, including requesting
features directly in-product. Additionally, our team will be hosting calls to
get detailed feedback and learn more from participants like you.

Early access will run until we open up Android developer verification to all
developers in March 2026.

## How early access works

Depending on the information you provided when you signed up for early access,
you'll be invited to participate in early access for either the new Android
Developer Console or the Play Console.

### Android Developer Console early access


For developers who only distribute apps outside of Google Play,
invitations for early access to Android Developer Console will start being
sent out on November 3. The email you provided when you signed up for
early access will be able to access Android Developer Console.


If you need to use a different email address, you can [submit a request](https://support.google.com/android-developer-console/contact/request_alternative_email). The email address you use must be associated with a
Google Account.

#### Verify your identity

Here's what you'll need to create and verify your Android Developer Console
account:

##### Individual account

- Legal name and address (to be verified by uploading an official government identity document)
- Contact email address (to be verified with a one-time password)
- Contact phone number (to be verified with a one-time password)
- $25 registration fee

##### Organization account

- D-U-N-S number
- Legal name and address, taken from your D-U-N-S profile (to be verified by uploading an official organization document)
- Official government identity document, from the account creator
- Contact email address (to be verified with a one-time password)
- Contact phone number (to be verified with a one-time password)
- Official website (to be verified using Google Search Console)
- $25 registration fee

#### Register your app's package names during early access

After verifying your Android developer identity information, you'll be able to
start registering your app's package names. We advise registering all your
current and future package names to ensure continued, smooth distribution on
[certified Android devices](https://www.android.com/certified/partners)
when enforcement starts in September 2026.

During early access, you will only be able to register package names for apps
where you own an eligible key. The ability to register packages with other keys
will roll out with the official launch in March 2026. For more information,
visit the [Android Developer Console Help Center](https://support.google.com/android-developer-console/answer/16450960).

#### Share your feedback during early access

Anything unclear or confusing? Got a feature request? During early access,
you'll be able to submit questions and feedback in-product, using a feedback
form that is accessible from the navigation menu on every page in Android
Developer Console.

We'll also be running a Discord forum for you to connect with our team,
allowing you to ask questions and share feedback directly. We'll include
instructions on how to join in your invite email.

#### Get an early look at the new Android Developer Console

Developer Console account, and get a walkthrough of the Android Developer
Console experience in our [first-look deck](https://support.google.com/android-developer-console/answer/16450960).

### Play Console early access

Invitations for early access to Play Console, for developers who distribute
on Google Play, will start being sent out on November 25. Invitations will
be sent to the account owner and global admins. In Play Console, early access
will be accessible using the new Android developer verification page.

#### Important note for Play developers: only register apps that you
distribute outside of Play during early access

During the Play Console early access, you can only register package
names for apps that you distribute outside of Google Play. In March 2026,
prior to the official launch of Android developer verification, we will try
to automatically register all of your Play apps for you. We expect to be able
to automatically register the vast majority of apps automatically. The Play
Console Home page will be updated to communicate which of your apps could
and couldn't be automatically registered.

You don't need to register package names for your Play apps at this time.

You'll also only be able to register package names for apps where you own
an eligible key. The ability to register packages with other keys will roll
out with the official launch in March 2026.

#### Get an early look at Android developer verification in Play Console

Android Developer verification in our [first-look deck](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16471116).

## Make sure to use the console and early access that's right for you

If you distribute apps on Google Play, either exclusively, or in combination
with apps distributed outside of Play, we recommend that you wait for the Play
Console early access, which will be available in November. If you distribute
apps on Play, and already have a Play Console account, you can complete all of
the necessary steps to meet Android developer verification requirements in Play
Console, including registering both your Play apps, and any apps that you
distribute outside of Play. You don't need to create an Android Developer
Console account.

Here's a handy table to help you make sure you're using the console and early
access that's right for you:

| If you want to distribute apps... | Use | Early access available on | Early access invite sent to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Only on Google Play | Use Play Console | November 25 | Play Console account owner and global admins |
| Both on and outside of Google Play | Use Play Console. There will be a new option to register package names for apps that you distribute outside of Play | November 25 | Play Console account owner and global admins |
| Only outside of Google Play | Create an account in the new Android Developer Console | November 3 | The email address you provided when you signed up for early access |
