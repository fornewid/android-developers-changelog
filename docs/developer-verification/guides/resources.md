### Troubleshooting

- **I've lost my signing key**: We strongly recommend all developers use a secure key management solution. If you lose your signing key you won't be able to register your packages.
- **My app uses multiple signing keys**: The Android developer console lets you add and verify multiple signing keys for a single package.
- **I don't have an "eligible" key** In cases where a package name is already in use, you may be informed that your key is not eligible to claim it outright. You should consider using a different package name. If this is not possible, you can request to register the package name, but this will require an additional review, and that package name may also be used by other developers.

## What your users will see

It is important to understand the user-facing impact of these new requirements.
After the regional enforcement deadline in **September 2026**, users will not be
able to install apps from unverified developers on a certified Android-powered
device. If they try to do this , they will see a system dialog letting them know
the install is blocked

This makes it critical that you complete your verification and registration to
verify your users can install your apps without interruption.

### What's next

We are committed to supporting you through this transition and are already
planning future improvements to make these processes easier, such as introducing
bulk upload and management features for developers with large app catalogs.
