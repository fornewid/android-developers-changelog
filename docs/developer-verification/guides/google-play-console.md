## For developers on Google Play Console

If you distribute your apps on Google Play, you must use the Play Console to
manage your Play package names.

The process is designed to be highly automated, leveraging the information you
have already provided.

### Identity verification

For most Play developers, **no new action is required for identity
verification**. Your existing verified identity (such as for Play's developer
verification requirements) meets this requirement.

You can confirm your current account information on the **Account details** page
in Play Console.

### Package name registration

A key part of this process is for developers to register their app package
names, which may include proving ownership of the private signing keys used for
those packages. Most Play developers have already shared their app ownership
information, so Play can automatically register most of your package names using
information that you've provided.

- **For new Play apps**: When you create a new app in the Google Play Console, Play will automatically register the package name and link it to your account. However, If that name is already used by another developer you will be prompted to pick another name. If you have been using this name off Play you will still be able to use it on Play too..
- **For existing Play apps**: When registration opens to all developers in March 2026, Google Play will automatically register all Play apps using information developers have already shared. We expect to automatically register 98% of all Play apps. The remaining 2% will require the developers to manually register these apps
