# Frequently asked questions

This guide answers some of the most common questions regarding Android developer verification.

## General

- **What happens if I don't comply?** If you do not verify your identity and register your apps by the September**deadline** , your apps will be blocked from being installed by users on[certified Android devices](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/)in applicable regions.*Last updated: Sept 3, 2025*
- **I'm just a hobbyist/student. What is "Limited Distribution"?** We understand that not everyone is a professional developer. We are introducing a free developer account type that will allow teachers, students, and hobbyists to distribute apps to a limited number of devices without needing to provide a government ID.*Last updated: Sept 11, 2025*
- **Will Android Debug Bridge (ADB) install work without registration?** As a developer, you are free to install apps without verification with ADB. This is designed to support developers' need to develop, test apps that are not intended or not yet ready to distribute to the wider consumer population.*Last updated: Sept 3, 2025*
- **Do enterprise apps need to complete the verification requirements?** Apps distributed through your organization store, on managed devices, won't need to complete the verification requirements since your IT admin has vetted them. However, we recommend to still register and claim these apps since this creates a smooth installation, if the app is downloaded from another source (not the managed store) or to a non-managed device.*Last updated: Sept 3, 2025*
- **If I want to modify or hack some apk and install it on my own device, do I have to verify?** Apps installed using ADB won't require verification. This will verify developers can build and test apps that aren't intended or not yet ready to distribute to the wider consumer population.*Last updated: Sept 11, 2025*

## Identity and accounts

- **What is a D-U-N-S number and how do I get one?** A D-U-N-S number is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses provided by Dun \& Bradstreet. It is required if you are registering as an**organization** . If your organization does not have one, you can[get one for free](https://www.dnb.com/en-us/smb/duns/get-a-duns.html)from the Dun \& Bradstreet website. The process can take up to 28 days so you should make preparations to obtain a D-U-N-S number.*Last updated: Sept 3, 2025*

- **Why is there a $25 fee for the ADC? How can I pay?** The $25 fee for the**Full Distribution** account in the ADC helps cover administrative costs and investment in protecting the ecosystem, similar to Play's $25 registration fee.
