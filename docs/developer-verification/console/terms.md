**Effective as of November 11, 2025**

**1. Applicable Terms**

1.1 Thanks for using the Android Developer Console ("ADC"). The ADC is a service
provided to developers at http://get.google.com/adc-early-access by Google LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company with principal place of business at 1600
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States; Google Ireland
Limited, a company incorporated in Ireland with principal place of business at
Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; Google Commerce Limited, a
company incorporated in Ireland with principal place of business at Gordon
House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; or Google Asia Pacific Pte. Limited, a
company incorporated in Singapore with principal place of business at 70 Pasir
Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City, Singapore 117371. Google may
update the Google entities and their addresses from time to time (collectively,
herein, referred to as "**Google", "we** " or "**us** "). Your use, as an
individual, of the ADC is subject to these Android Developer Console Terms of
Service (the "**Terms**").

1.2 These Terms form a legally binding contract between You and Google in
relation to Your use of the ADC.

1.3 You must accept these terms in order to use the ADC.

1.4 The ADC includes web and mobile web versions of the ADC that Google may make
available to You.

1.5 The purpose of the ADC is to enable developers to register, verify their
identity, and identify the package(s) that You plan to distribute on devices
running the Android operating system with Google Mobile Services ("GMS Android
devices"). Failure to complete Your verification and registration may result in
Your applications being blocked from installation.

**2. Account Types**

2.1. Limited Distribution Accounts. Google recognizes that the needs of
individual developers using the ADC for non-commercial purposes, such as
students or hobbyists, may differ from those of commercial organizations. As
such, Google may offer a separate type of ADC account for these developers. If
You register for a limited distribution account, You acknowledge and agree that
Your use of the ADC may be subject to different or additional terms, including
but not limited to, different verification requirements, functionality, and/or
distribution limitations. Any such terms will be presented to You during the
registration process for that specific account type and will govern Your use of
that account.

**3. Definitions**

**Account Owner**: The user who initially created the ADC account.

**Console User**: Additional users of the Android Developer Console.

**You**: Any individual user of the Android Developer Console, either as an
Account Owner or as a Console User.

**4. Privacy and Information**

4.1. Any data collected or used pursuant to Your use of the ADC is in accordance
with Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Additionally, there are some
special cases explained below applicable to data that Google collects in
connection with the ADC.

**5. Restrictions on Use**

You may not use the ADC:

- beyond the intended ADC functionality outlined in the Terms and other ADC documentation;
  - to engage in, promote or encourage illegal activity or abusive behavior;
  - to disable, interfere with, reverse engineer, or circumvent any aspect of the ADC; or
  - to access any other Google product or service in a manner that violates the terms of service of such other Google product or service.

**6. Modification and Termination of Services**

6.1 Google may change, discontinue, or limit access to any ADC feature or
functionality, if You are found to have distributed malware without liability to
You or the Account Owner.

6.2 If Google discontinues the ADC, where reasonably possible, Google will give
You reasonable advance notice. Google may, at its discretion, discontinue the
ADC.

6.3 Google may make changes to the Terms at any time with notice and the
opportunity to decline further use of the ADC. Google will post notice of
modifications to the Terms on the [ADC](http://get.google.com/adc-early-access) and by emailing Your
contact email. Changes will not be retroactive. They will become effective, and
will be deemed accepted by You, (a) immediately for those who become Account
Owners or ADC Users after the notification is posted; or (b) for pre-existing
Account Owner and ADC Users, on the date specific in the notice, which will be
no sooner than thirty (30) days after the changes are posted (except changes
addressing new functions of the ADC Console or changes required by law will be
effective immediately).

6.4 If You do not agree with the modifications to the Terms, You may terminate
Your use of the ADC, which will be Your sole and exclusive remedy. You agree
that Your continued use of the ADC constitutes Your agreement to the
modifications of the Terms.

6.5 If You violate any of the Terms or if You distribute malware or other
harmful applications, Google may terminate Your access to the ADC.

**7. General Legal Terms**

7.1 The English language version of the Terms will control. Any translations, if
any, are non-binding and provided for reference only.

7.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
remedy contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any
applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights
and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

7.3 If any court of law having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter rules
that any provision of the Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed
from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions
of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

7.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies
comprising Google will be a third -party beneficiary to the Terms and that such
other companies will be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
provision of the Terms that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.
Other than this, no other person or company will be a third -party beneficiary
to the Terms.

7.5 Except in the case of a change of control (for example, through a stock
purchase or sale, merger, or other form of corporate transaction), the rights
granted in the Terms may not be assigned or transferred by either You or Google
without the prior approval of the other party. Any other attempt to assign is
void.

7.6 All claims arising out of or relating to the Terms or Your relationship with
Google under the Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California,
excluding California's conflict of laws provisions. You and Google further agree
to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located
within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
from or relating to the Terms or Your relationship with Google under the Terms,
except that You agree that Google will be allowed to apply for injunctive relief
in any jurisdiction. If You are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States
government entity or a United States city, county, or state government entity,
then the following applies instead of the foregoing: the parties agree to remain
silent regarding governing law and venue.
