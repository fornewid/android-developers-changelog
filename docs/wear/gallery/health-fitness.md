### Being active

People use smartwatches to track their workouts or daily activity for many reasons, such as maintaining a level of activity, improving their performance, or working towards a specific goal. Fitness apps can provide motivation and also allow people to reflect on their fitness journey.

### Restricted setting

There are certain contexts where people may not have access to their mobile phones. In this case their watch enables them to quickly glance at important health and fitness information that matters to them such as heart rate or step count.

### Select \& start an exercise

Use Wear OS glanceable surfaces such as tiles and complications, so that people can quickly see metrics from any workout.

Help people track all workout types from their smartwatch so they can improve over time.

### Monitor stats and progress during exercise

The smartwatch is always on-body and can give the most accurate data.

Thoughtfully position your workout metrics so people can track at a glance while on the move. Present core metrics on one screen and use the horizontal page carousel to give quick access to important actions like ending a workout.

Use the Ongoing Activity API so that people can quickly return to their workout app from key surfaces such as the watchface.

### Review an exercise

Once a workout finishes, show people how they've done to encourage progress. Our scaling list supports cards and chips so you can display the data that matters.
