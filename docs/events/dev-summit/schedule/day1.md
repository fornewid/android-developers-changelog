| 11:20-12:00 Session              | ### Android at Large: How to Bring Optimized Experiences to the Big Screen #### Kenneth Ford, Pietro Maggi With Android making its way to new form factors, and OEM's pushing the boundaries with new technology, it's time to take a look at what these environments bring to you and your users. It's crucial that your developer workflow accounts for resizability, new display sizes and aspect ratios, multi display, and app continuity to provide your users the best experience no matter where they are. The days of taking the easy road with screenOrientation="portrait" are quickly coming to an end. In this talk we discuss the challenges faced when looking to support Android on various platforms, and how to make sure that you're providing a great experience on all of these form-factors. You will leave this talk with an actionable checklist that helps stabilize your app and user experience on any device.

In Room 2.2 we've added several highly requested features: better support for relationships, integration with Kotlin Flows, pre-packaged databases, partial entities, schema default values and faster build speed. In this talk, you'll learn about these features and how using them in your app will enable more advanced functionality and require less code to write and maintain.

| 14:50-15:10 Session              | ### LiveData with Coroutines and Flow #### Jose Alcérreca, Yigit Boyar LiveData is a simple lifecycle-aware observable, designed for making UIs that react to changes safely and efficiently. It can be used beyond View↔️ViewModel communications and even components like Room support it. However, there's a risk of overuse, especially when dealing with multiple threads. The solution? Instead of expanding its features, LiveData now works seamlessly with Kotlin's coroutines. In this talk, we cover the new "liveData" coroutine builder, showing when and how to use it and testing patterns and antipatterns to make clean, efficient, and solid reactive UIs.

In this talk, we explore why variance makes regression detection difficult, and strategies we use while writing Jetpack libraries. We will review the new Jetpack Benchmark library, and how to use it to measure hot code paths, from RecyclerView scrolling to database queries.

| 17:20-17:40 Session              | ### Google Play Billing: The "Purchase Anywhere" Paradigm Shift #### Oscar Rodriguez In the past few years, we have introduced new features into Google Play, that enable users to discover and purchase items and subscriptions in many new ways, from inside and outside the app. Developers who have adopted these changes in their apps have seen improvements in user experience, and with it, substantial growth in revenue. However, integrating these features into an app or game requires a fundamental change in which you think about how purchases are made and consumed. This session takes a deep dive into designing for Purchase Anywhere. We will talk about promotions, subscribe-and-install, cash purchases and pending transactions, and remote purchase approvals. All app and game developers using Google Play Billing are welcome to attend.
