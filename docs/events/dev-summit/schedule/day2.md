| 9:30-10:10 Session               | ### Navigating Your Way Around Customizable Delivery #### Ben Weiss, Wojtek Kaliciński, Dom Elliott, Jason Liu With app bundles and dynamic delivery, developers now have the option to make parts of their apps available based on various user states or even on-demand at runtime. This is a big departure from the single-APK world, and we have heard loud and clear that you would like to see more support for migrating to this new model. During this session, we will announce new tools and libraries that address some of the developer feedback that we have been gathering since the original launch. You can expect a deep dive on testing dynamic feature modules, a simplified on-demand installation API using Jetpack and Kotlin, and a new way to manage dependencies between multiple modules.

| 10:20-11:00 Session              | ### Performance Myth Busters #### Calin Juravle, Diana Wong, David Sehr, Eric Holk Let's explore what myths we can bust about Android app performance! Are enums not OK? How many dex files is optimal? Is object pooling really a good thing? Can implementing Kotlin really impact app performance? Along with some best practices on performance profiling and benchmarking, we put these questions (and more!) to the test and find out which are true and which myths get...busted.

Proper use of it can make your layouts easier to maintain and support dark themes or implement material theming to systematically customize Material Design to better reflect your product's brand. This talk will start with a crash course in themes and styles and how to apply styling throughout your app while isolating theme dependent resources. We'll then walk through applied examples of using the styling system to build material themed apps and dark themes.

Or, maybe you have a library or project that is written in Java and already has been used in so many Kotlin or Java projects. In this talk, we will look at the best practices for writing Kotlin and Java code that works so seamlessly from the other that the only way to what language it is written in is to look at the source code.

Not only can you easily tackle singular tasks like Text recognition, Face Detection or Language detection, but you can also create more complex user experiences by chaining multiple ML Kit APIs or using these in combination with your own custom models.

In Android, we want to provide users control and transparency over their data, and have made a number of changes in Android 10 that bring greater restrictions to what data apps can access. We will review the changes in Android 10 and introduce new concepts we have been working on for future releases.

Designing for quality is even more important as the way users discover and purchase your one-time products and subscriptions changes. In this session, we'll show how you can increase purchase reliability and performance, while preparing for the future of "Purchase Anywhere". We'll cover RTDN, Play Developer APIs, refunded purchases, and frictionless subscriptions. We'll show how Billing Library 2 makes updates easy and improves performance, as well as how to migrate from AIDL and Billing Library 1 before the deadline.

However, testing async code has never been an easy task. In this talk, we show you how to master test asynchronicity with coroutines to get that precious green check ✔️. Which questions do you have to ask yourself before writing a line of test code? How can you test coroutines that use Dispatchers.Main? What if you want to control the timing of your events? Why shouldn't you use Dispatchers.Unconfined? Come and learn how to test coroutines like a pro.
