You should be testing your integration throughout development. To test during
the development phase, we recommend leveraging *license testers* and [*Play
Billing Lab*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.play.billingtestcompanion) to run through the scenarios described in this section.

## License Testers

To configure license testers, see [Test in-app billing with application
licensing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6062777).

Using license testers provide the following benefits:

- Ordinarily, the Google Play Billing Library is blocked for apps that aren't signed and uploaded to Google Play. License testers can bypass this check, meaning you can sideload apps for testing, even for apps using debug builds with debug signatures without the need to upload to the new version of your app. Note that the package name must match that of the app that is configured for Google Play, and the Google Account must be a license tester for the Google Play Console account.
- License testers have access to test payment methods that avoid charging the testers real money for purchases. You can also use test payment methods to simulate certain situations, such as when a payment is declined. Figure 1 shows these test forms of payment as they appear within the purchase flow.
- License testers can [rapidly test subscription features](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#subs).

![license testers have access to test payment methods](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/test-payment-methods.png) **Figure 1.** License testers have access to test payment methods.

Here are some additional details about the test purchase process:

- Test purchases use the same app purchase flow used by actual purchases.
- Taxes are not computed for test purchases.
- Google Play indicates a test purchase by displaying a notice across the center of the purchase dialog.

You can confirm the account that is making a purchase by expanding the purchase
dialog. Note the following:

- Test accounts must be on the tester's Android-powered device.
- If the device has more than one account, the purchase is made with the account that downloaded the app.
- If none of the accounts have downloaded the app, the purchase is made with the first account.

Before distributing your app, you can make use of Google Play [test tracks](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213)
to perform additional validation. For example, you can take advantage of the
test tracks to have your QA team qualify a new release.

With test tracks, users can install your app from Google Play and test a version
of your app that is not yet publicly available. Users can make real purchases
using any of their payment methods in Google Play.
| **Note:** User purchases in test tracks result in actual charges to user accounts unless the user is also a license tester.

To test your Google Play Billing Library integration using test tracks, do
the following:

1. Publish your app to a [test track](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213). Note that after you publish an app to a testing track, it can take a few hours for the app to be available for testers.
2. Ensure each tester [opts-in to your app's test](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213). On your test's opt-in URL, your testers see an explanation of what it means to be a tester along with a link to opt-in.

You can test your integration on any Android-powered hardware device running
Android 1.6 or higher. The most current version of the Google Play application
must be installed on the device. For general information about how to set up a
device for use in developing Android applications, see [Using Hardware
Devices](https://developer.android.com/tools/device).
| **Note:**
|
| - While license testers are recommended for development and testing, ensure you also test your app using non-license tester accounts, either occasionally or when making large changes. Non-license testing helps to ensure that your app does not rely on testing specific logic such as renewal durations.
| - Users in the testing tracks can also be license testers for your app.

## Play Billing Lab

Play Billing Lab is an Android app that helps developers test their integration
with Google Play's billing system. It provides a convenient way for developers
to test billing features, integrate faster, and launch with higher confidence.
You can download and install Play Billing Lab from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.play.billingtestcompanion).

Play Billing Lab lets you to do the following in your testing:

- Change [Play Country](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7431675) from within Play Billing Lab and apply the settings to your test. This enables [testing custom user-experiences in different
  countries/regions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#regions) regardless of where the tester is physically testing
- [Test trial or introductory offers](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#trial-offers) repeatedly with the same account
- [Test subscription price changes](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#price-changes) without affecting other active subscribers
- [Accelerate subscription state transition](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#subscription-state-transition) to accelerate subscription renewals, or move your test subscription into grace period or account hold state with one click to speed up your testing
- [Test with real payment methods](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#real-fop-testing) to bypass certain purchase flow risk signals

![Play Billing Lab Dashboard](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/play-billing-lab-dashboard.png) **Figure 2.** Play Billing Lab Dashboard. **Note:**
|
| - Be sure to log into Play Billing Lab using the same account as the billing account. Be sure that the account is registered as a license tester for the app under test. Play country, testing trial or introductory offers, and testing with real payment methods configurations expire in 2 hours.
| - If you get errors when applying changes in Play Billing Lab, log into Play Billing Lab again and retry. If you notice long delay for the configuration to be applied or you are using another Android-powered device to perform the testing, clear the Play Store cache manually on the device on which the test was performed after you have made configuration changes in the Play Billing Lab.

## Test one-time products

### Test consumable products

When testing consumable products, test a variety of situations, including the
following:

- A successful purchase where the user receives an item. With a license tester, you can use the **Test instrument, always approves** payment method.
- A purchase where the payment method failed to be charged, and the user shouldn't receive the item. With a license tester you can use the **Test
  instrument, always declines** payment method.
- Ensure items can be purchased multiple times.

Verify that purchases are properly acknowledged as described in [processing
purchases](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#process). For purchases from license testers, a purchase will be refunded
after 3 minutes if your app does not acknowledge the purchase and you will
receive an email about the cancellation. You can also check the **Orders** tab
in the Google Play Console to see if an order was refunded after 3 minutes.

### Test non-consumable products

Non-consumables should be tested the same as consumables, but you should verify
an item cannot be purchased again within your app. Be sure to verify purchase
acknowledgement for both non-consumables and consumables (when applicable) since
the logic to process each the two types of purchases vary.
| **Note:** To perform multiple test purchases for the same non-consumable product, you can [refund and revoke purchases using Google Play Console](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2741495).

### Test pending purchases

Test a pending purchase where the item should be granted when the purchase state
becomes `PURCHASED`. License testers have access to two test instruments for
delayed forms of payment where the payment automatically completes or cancels
after a couple of minutes.

1. Make a purchase with a delayed form of payment **Slow test card, declines
   after a few minutes**, as shown in figure 3. Restart the app, validate that
   the purchase has not been granted.

   ![test a purchase with a declined slow test card](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/test-delayed-payment-methods-decline.png) **Figure 3.** Test a purchase with a declined slow test card.

   <br />

2. Make a purchase with a delayed form of payment **Slow test card, approves
   after a few minutes**, as shown in figure 4. Wait a few minutes, validate
   that the purchase has been granted.

   ![test a purchase with an approved slow test card](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/test-delayed-payment-methods-approve.png) **Figure 4.** Test a purchase with an approved slow test card.

   <br />

You can find more information at [Handling pending transactions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#pending).

## Test subscription-specific features

The purchase flows for one-time products and subscriptions are similar, but
subscriptions have additional scenarios, such as successful or declined
subscription renewals. To test renewals, you can use the
**Test card, always approves** and **Test card, always declines** payment
methods that are available for license testers, as shown in figure 1. Use these
payment instruments to test scenarios beyond the successful subscription
scenario.
| **Caution:** The resubscribe and pause features are always enabled in license tester accounts even if they're disabled in the Play Console. Test these features in license testers, confirm that they work, and then enable them in the console for all users. To test your app's behavior when these features are disabled, you must use a non-license-tester account.

Similar to one-time products, verify that purchases are properly acknowledged as
described in [processing purchases](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#process). For purchases from license testers, a
purchase is refunded after 3 minutes if your app does not acknowledge the
purchase, and you receive an email about the cancellation. You can also check
the **Orders** tab in Google Play Console to see if an order was
refunded after 3 minutes.

### Renewal periods

Test subscriptions renew more quickly than actual subscriptions, and test
subscriptions can renew a maximum of six times, not counting free trials and
introductory periods.

The following table lists the testing renewal times for subscriptions of various
durations. These times are approximate. You may see small variations in the
precise time of an event. To compensate for variation, call the API to view the
current status after every subscription expiration date.

|---|---|
| **Production subscription period** | **Test subscription renewal** |
| 1 week | 5 minutes |
| 1 month | 5 minutes |
| 3 months | 10 minutes |
| 6 months | 15 minutes |
| 1 year | 30 minutes |

Time-based subscription features such as free trials are also shortened for
testing. The following table identifies the testing time periods associated with
time-based subscription features:

|---|---|
| **Feature** | **Test period** |
| Account hold | 10 minutes |
| Free trial | 3 minutes |
| Grace period | 5 minutes |
| Introductory price period | Same as subscription test period |
| Pause (1 month) | 5 minutes |
| Pause (2 months) | 10 minutes |
| Pause (3 months) | 15 minutes |
| Price step-up consent period (applicable only for the South Korea (KR) region) | 3 minutes |
| Purchase acknowledgement | 5 minutes |

### Accelerate subscription state transition

You can also use Play Billing Lab and license testers to accelerate the [test
subscriptions renewal periods](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#renewals) to speed up your subscription testing or move
the test subscription to grace period or account hold state to test [payment
decline](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/subscriptions#payment-declines) scenarios with the following steps:

1. Click **Manage** on the **Subscription settings** card in the **Dashboard**.
2. Choose the active subscription you want to test.
3. Click the **Subscription state** drop-down menu.
4. Click the target state to update the subscription state.

![subscription state transition](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/play-billing-lab-subscription-state-transition.png) **Figure 5.** Test subscription state transition.

Once you've selected the target subscription state in the drop-down menu, the
test subscription state will update shortly afterward.

Note that:

- Test subscriptions must be acknowledged before using the Accelerate Subscription State Transition feature.
- Your payment method will automatically decline when you move the test subscription to grace period or account hold state. When you restore the test subscription, your payment method will restore to automatic approval.
- The subscription state transition process might take a few seconds to execute.
- When the subscription state transition is in progress, the subscription price change feature is not available.
- If you renew the test subscription when a price change is in effect, Play applies the new price if the user has accepted it. However, if the new price requires user acceptance and the user hasn't agreed to it yet, Play cancels the subscription.

### Trial Offers

With the Play Billing Lab trial offer testing feature, a license tester can test
and use free trial or introductory offers an unlimited number of times by
checking the **Test free trial or introductory offer** checkbox and applying the
change. This removes the need to create multiple accounts to test a trial offer
only available to new subscribers.
![test trial offers](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/trial-offers-testing.png) **Figure 6.** Test trial offers.

### Price changes

You can also use Play Billing Lab and license testers to test [subscription
price changes](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/price-changes) without affecting other active subscribers with the following
steps:

1. Click **Manage** on the **Subscription settings** card in the **Dashboard**.
2. Choose the active subscription you want to test.
3. Enter the new price.
4. Select or unselect the **User opt-out** checkbox per your test requirement.
5. Click **Apply**.

![test subscription price change](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/play-billing-lab-price-change.png) **Figure 7.** Test subscription price change.

After applying your changes, the price is updated starting from the next renewal
only for the tester. Other active subscribers won't be affected. All the license
testers rules apply to the test subscription. The tester can then test their app
for downstream processes triggered by the price change, such as price change
notifications.

Keep the following considerations in mind when planning test periods:

- Due to a small renewal duration for license testers, it's possible that a price migration made from the console won't register for license testers. To ensure that price change notifications and emails can be tested, developers should defer billing by at least one hour after triggering a price change.
- Price decreases don't have a notification period. Users are notified of a price decrease soon after cohort migration. This is unchanged when testing.
- For price increases, test notification times are calculated the same as with actual increases:
  - The user is first charged at the first billing anniversary following a mandatory notification period.
  - Notification times are calculated backward from the first charge date.
  - The final notification is always 1 minute before the charge, regardless of billing period.

The following table shows test billing and notification periods for several
actual billing periods:

|---|---|---|---|
| **Actual base plan billing period** | **Test billing period** | **Test notification period (opt-in and opt-out regions with 30 day notice)** | **Test notification period (opt-out regions with 60 day notice)** |
| 1 week | 5 minutes | 5 minutes | 10 minutes |
| 1 month | 5 minutes | 5 minutes | 10 minutes |
| 3 months | 10 minutes | 3 minutes | 6 minutes |
| 6 months | 15 minutes | 2 minutes | 4 minutes |
| 1 year | 30 minutes | 3 minutes | 6 minutes |

### Price step-up consent

| **Note:** The price step-up consent feature is available only to the subscriptions in the South Korea (KR) region.

Information related to a price step-up that requires user consent will be
available to you in the [`purchases.subscriptionsv2.get`](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.subscriptionsv2/get) API.

Google Play sends two push and email price step-up notifications to the relevant
users (including license testers) before the step-up is live. The notification
period for testing is as follows:

|---|---|
| **Notification schedule** | **Test notification period** |
| First notification | 3 minutes |
| Second (final) notification | 1 minute |

## Test pending transactions

You should test pending transactions are handled correctly and entitlements are
updated accordingly when the purchase state becomes `PURCHASED`. License testers
have access to two test instruments for delayed forms of payment where the
payment automatically completes or cancels after a couple of minutes.

1. Make a purchase with a delayed form of payment **Slow test card, declines
   after a few minutes**, as shown in figure 8. Restart the app, validate that
   the purchase has not been granted.

   ![test a purchase with a declined slow test card](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/test-delayed-payment-methods-decline.png) **Figure 8.** Test a purchase with a declined slow test card.

   <br />

2. Make a purchase with a delayed form of payment **Slow test card, approves
   after a few minutes**, as shown in figure 9. Wait a few minutes, validate
   that the purchase has been granted.

   ![test a purchase with an approved slow test card](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/test-delayed-payment-methods-approve.png) **Figure 9.** Test a purchase with an approved slow test card.

   <br />

## Test promo codes

You can use the Google Play Console to [create codes for your own
testing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6321495). Keep in mind that you may only create 500 promo codes per quarter
across all managed products in an app.

You should test the following promo code redemption scenarios:

- When the promo code is entered in the purchase dialog that was launched within your app.
- When the promo code is redeemed in the Google Play Store app.
- When the promo code is redeemed at <https://play.google.com/store> using the **Redeem** button in the left-hand navigation.

Within these scenarios, you should test redeeming codes in as many ways as
possible. Perform the following tests at a minimum:

- Redemption before the app is installed.
- Redemption while the app is running in the foreground. Note that for this test, you need another device to test using the Google Play Store app. Be sure to test redemptions from different screens in your app.
- Redemption with [multi-window mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window), where both your app and the Google Play Store app are being displayed at the same time.

For each test, make sure that the item is correctly detected and that the user
is notified.

## Test the purchase experience in different regions

You can test the purchase experience with or without the Play Billing Lab:

### Test
with

The [Play Billing Lab](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#play-billing-lab) Android app lets you test the purchase flow in
any region. However, to use the Play Billing Lab, you must be a license
tester. Use the following steps to test:

### Test
without

You can also test the purchase flow in any region without using the Play
Billing Lab. Use the following steps to test:

1. Create a new Gmail account. The account can be created in any country.
2. Optionally, you can set up the user a license tester.
3. VPN into the required country to test.
4. Launch the purchase flow.

You can clear Play Store data and cache, and then repeat steps #3 and #4
with any country you would like to test. After switching to a new
country, you will need to Clear Data for the Google Play Store to remove
data related to the previous country.

Both these methods for testing purchases let you test offer regional eligibility
and the user experience in any region, regardless of where you are physically
testing.
