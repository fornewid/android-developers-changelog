| **Note:** Manual reporting of alternative billing only and user choice billing is being sunset. Please find more details about migration deadlines [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13821247). To learn about what transactions need to be migrated and how to migrate see [Migrating from manual reporting](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative/backend#migrating-manual) for more information.

Eligible developers are able to offer to users in certain countries an
alternative billing system in their app and report resulting transactions to
Google. Depending on where you distribute your app and eligibility, there are
two versions of alternative billing that an app can build:

- [**Alternative billing with user choice**](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative#offering-alternative): Your app offers an alternative billing alongside Google Play's billing system in [eligible regions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13821247).
- [**Alternative billing**](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative#offering-alternative-only): Your app offers an alternative billing system that may include Google Play Billing ([subject to program terms](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/16471103)).

This guide addresses the APIs that need to be used for either offering. You
should review the [program pages](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13821247) and enroll in relevant programs before
using these APIs.

## Glossary of terms

Term conventions followed by this guide:

- **Alternative billing APIs**: APIs used to display any applicable screens to users and enable developers to report transactions completed on the developer's alternative billing system.
- **Alternative billing system**: A developer's alternative billing system which may be offered alongside Google Play's billing system or on its own (subject to eligibility requirements).
- **External transaction**: A transaction that occurs outside of Google Play's billing system.
- **External transaction token**: A token provided to the developer through the Play Billing Library for the developer to use when the user completes an alternative billing system. This token is used to notify Google Play of a successful purchase.
- **External transaction ID**: A unique identifier generated by the developer to identify a transaction.

## Offering alternative billing with User Choice

This section describes how to offer your users alternative billing with the
choice of using Google Play's billing system. Before using these APIs, ensure
the following:

- Review the eligibility requirements for the relevant program(s) and complete the onboarding steps outlined in [Understanding user choice billing on
  Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13821247).
- Integrate [Play Billing Library
  5.2](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/release-notes) or higher.

The rest of the Google Play Billing integration recommended modules are the same
as developers already would have for their current [integration](https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-billing).

Additionally, we recommend having a [Google Play Developer API integration
setup](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started) ready because the backend integration will leverage it.

### Configuring in Play Console

Developers that have completed enrollment for the corresponding [alternative
billing with user choice program](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13821247) and are integrated with alternative billing
APIs can manage their alternative billing settings through [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers):

- For each of your eligible apps, you can choose whether to offer an alternative billing system or not.
- Upload payment method logos in accordance with the [guidelines](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative#image-asset), following all of the format specifications. Images that do not conform to these guidelines will not be displayed for your alternative billing system on the user choice screen. (Note: Including payment method logos is optional, though highly recommended.)
- If you offer subscriptions, provide the required subscription management link.

### User experience

| **Note:** If you are offering user choice billing through alternative billing APIs, the user experience requirements will be met by integrating with and using the client-side APIs. You will not need to separately follow the interim user experience guidelines ([for South Korea](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing-choice), [for other eligible markets](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/user-choice)).

The client-side APIs enable the following functionality:

- Google Play renders and manages the applicable information and user choice screens
- If the user chooses to use Google Play's billing system, the billing flow continues using Google Play's billing standard interface.

#### User choice screen

The user choice screen presents users with the option to use either the
developer's alternative billing system or Google Play's billing system.

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/alternative/alt-bill-anatomy-2.png)

The alternative billing option on the user choice screen includes the following
UI elements:

1. App icon.
2. App name.
3. Image asset that includes payment methods offered by the developer.
4. Additional indicator (*and more* UI element is not part of the image asset).

### Image asset for payment methods

The single image asset is made up of multiple payment method cards and must
follow the specifications defined in these guidelines.

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/alternative/alt-bill-asset.png)

|---|---|
| Dimensions | 192dp X 20dp |
| Card spacing | 8dp |
| File format | PNG, transparent background |

### Payment method variations

Developers can choose the number of available payment method icons they wish to
include in the image asset, up to a maximum of 5.

No other images or text should be included in the image.

### Next steps

To begin integrating the alternative billing APIs with user choice, follow the
in-depth guides for both [in-app integration](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative/alternative-billing-with-user-choice-in-app) and [backend integration](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alternative/backend).

## Offering alternative billing only

This section describes how to offer your users alternative billing. Before using
these APIs, finish the following prerequisites:

- Review the requirements and enroll in one of the [alternative billing programs](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/16471103).
- Integrate [Play Billing Library 6.2.1](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/release-notes) or higher.

We recommend having a [Google Play Developer API integration setup](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started) ready
because the backend integration will be built on it.

### Configuring in Play Console

| **Note:** If you are not yet ready to integrate with the alternative billing APIs, continue to make changes to your enrollment status through the [enrollment form](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/alternative_billing_edit_package) instead of the Play Console.

Developers that have completed enrollment and are integrated with alternative
billing APIs can manage their alternative billing settings through [Play
Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers):

- For each of your eligible apps, opt in or out of offering an alternative billing only (without user choice) in each available country

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/google/play/billing/alternative/alt-bill-settings.png) Mock UI, intended for illustrative purposes, subject to change.

### Information screen for users

| **Note:** If you are offering alternative billing only through alternative billing APIs, the user experience requirements will be met by integrating with the client-side APIs. You will not need to separately follow the [interim user
| experience guidelines](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/alt-billing).

The information screen helps users understand that only an alternative billing
system is being offered within the eligible app. The information screen will be
shown to users at the start of their first purchase in your app after
alternative billing has been enabled. This message will not be displayed on
subsequent purchases made by the same user in your app on the same device. Note
that there may be times when the dialog is shown again to a user in situations
such as if the user clears caches on their device.
