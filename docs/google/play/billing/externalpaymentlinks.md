The external payments program lets you lead users in Japan, including through external payment links, to your in-app digital features or services that are available for purchase outside your apps. When linking users to purchases, they must be given a side by side choice of making the purchase with Google Play Billing or completing the purchase on the developer's website. This guide covers the APIs required to enable external payments. For more details, see the[program requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16787536).

## Glossary of terms

Term conventions followed by this guide:

- **External payments APIs**: APIs used to link the user outside of the app to purchase in-app digital items.
- **External transaction** : A qualifying transaction that occurs outside of the app as defined by the[program requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16787536).
- **External transaction token**: A token provided to the developer through the Play Billing Library for you to use when the user completes an external transaction. This token is used to notify Google Play of a successful purchase.

## User experience

The client-side APIs enable the following functionality:

- Google Play renders and manages the applicable information and user choice screens
- If the user chooses to use Google Play's billing system, the billing flow continues using Google Play's billing standard interface.
- If the user chooses your billing system, the user will be directed to an external website or a payment app already installed on the user's device. You may decide whether Google Play or your app will direct the user to the website.
