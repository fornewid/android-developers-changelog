A one-time product (previously referred as in-app product) refers to a digital item or content that a user can purchase with a single charge to their payment method. Unlike subscriptions, which involve recurring payments, a one-time product is a single transaction that grants access to the purchased content permanently or for a specific, non-renewable use.

One-time products are categorized into two main types:

- Consumable products - These are products that a user consumes to receive in-app content and can be bought multiple times. Once used, the product is "consumed" and can be purchased again. Examples include in-game currency (like coins or gems), extra lives, or boosts.

- Non-consumable products - These products are purchased once and provide a permanent benefit. Once bought, they are permanently associated with the user's account, and cannot be purchased again. Examples include premium upgrades, unlocking additional game levels, or ad-free versions of an app.
