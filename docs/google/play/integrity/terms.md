## Data safety

Google Play has a [data safety
section](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/11416267) for developers
to disclose their apps' data collection, sharing, and security practices. To
help you complete the data safety section requirements, you can use the
information below on how the Play Integrity API handles data.

The Play Integrity API is a runtime interface with the Google Play Store. As
such, when you use Play Integrity in your app, the Play Store runs its own
processes, which include handling data as governed by the [Google Play Terms of
Service](https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/play-terms/index.html). The
information below describes how the Play Integrity API handles data to process
specific requests from your app.

|---|---|
| Data collected on usage | Always collected: - App-provided information in the request including the `requestHash` and `nonce` fields - App metadata including package name, version number, and signing certificate - The app's [Google Play license status](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/verdicts#account-details-field) for the signed in user accounts on the device - Device information including a key attestation certificate and a device attestation token generated by Google Play services Only collected when the requesting app is opted in to receiving [environment details](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/verdicts#environment-details-field): - App activity information used to determine if apps are running that can capture the screen or control the device - Device information used to determine the status of Google Play Protect |
| Purpose of data collection | The data collected is used to verify the application integrity, the licensing status, environment details, and the device integrity. |
| Data encryption | Data is encrypted. |
| Data sharing | Data is not transferred to any third parties. |
| Data deletion | Data is deleted following a fixed retention period. |

While we aim to be as transparent as possible, you are solely responsible for
deciding how to respond to
[Google Play's data safety section form](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469)
regarding your app's user data collection, sharing, and security practices.
