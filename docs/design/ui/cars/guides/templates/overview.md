# Templates overview

The Android for Cars App Library helps you build apps that work with both:[Android Auto](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/platforms/android-auto)and[Android Automotive OS](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/platforms/automotive-os)

The Android for Cars App Library:

- **Provides vehicle-optimized**templates and components that you can assemble into task flows to design your app's user interface.
- **Handles important functions**such as responsive screen sizing so your app can work effectively in all compatible vehicles.
- **Is available for multiple app categories** :[See the full list here](https://developer.android.com/training/cars#supported-app-categories).

This section describes all available templates and the components included on each. To see a list of requirements your apps should meet, see[Templated app requirements](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/ux-requirements/overview#templates).
| **Note:** While the design process for templates is the same for both Android Auto and Android Automotive OS (AAOS), the development process involves producing two different APKs. For technical guidance on building an app with templates, see[Using the Android for Cars App Library](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps).
