# Media Playback template

Display details about the media being played at a glance with the Media Playback template.

With this template, you can choose which actions to allow users to perform from the playback screen.

You'll need to decide the following:

- Which buttons to show in the header section.
- Which playback buttons and images to show (provided through Media Session).
