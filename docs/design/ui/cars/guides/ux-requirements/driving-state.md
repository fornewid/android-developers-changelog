# Consider driving state

Some tasks may require too much attention for users to complete while driving. In those cases, use parked-only templates or enable your app to pause the task during the drive and continue it while parked.

The following templates are designed to accommodate parked scenarios:

- [List template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/list-template)(shows more text when parked than while driving)
- [Long Message template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/long-message-template)(parked only)
- [Sign-in template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/sign-in-template)(parked only)

To enable[task flows](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/ux-requirements/plan-task-flows#short)longer than 5 steps while parked, use the[Adaptive task limits](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/ux-requirements/plan-task-flows#task-limits)feature. This feature can also pause a task after 5 steps while driving and continue it when parked.
