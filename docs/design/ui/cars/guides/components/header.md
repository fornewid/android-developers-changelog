# Headers help drivers understand which app and what part of the app they're using. They need to be brief and easy to read at a glance while on the road.  
Headers must include at least one of the following: text, app icon, or back button.

**Headers can include:**

- Icon or image (optional), such as app icon
- Text (limited to one line -- longer text is truncated), typically the title of the screen
- Refresh button (only on[Place List templates](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/place-list-map-template))
- Back[button](https://developer.android.com/cars/design/create-apps/apps-for-drivers/components/button)(optional)

This example shows different types of headers you can create.

## Template support

You can use a header in all templates except the[Navigation template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/navigation-template). In map-based templates, the header appears in the card. Otherwise, it incorporates the optional[action strip](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/components/action-strip).
