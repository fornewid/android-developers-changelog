# Floating action button (FAB)

Floating action buttons (FABs) place the most important actions on the screen a tap away.  
Floating action buttons must include the following:

- Icon with no label
- Background color
In this example, the plus sign button in the lower right corner gives users the option to add another destination to their trip.

## Template support

FABs are supported by the[Grid template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/grid-template)and the[List template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/list-template).

## Guidance

- Each Grid or List template supports up to 2 FABs, which appears in the lower right corner.
- Use a FAB for the most important action on the screen.
- FABs don't include text labels, so make sure the icon is easy to understand without supporting text.

| **Note:** If the List or Grid template is embedded in a[Tab template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/tab-template), an action strip is not allowed. Use a FAB instead.
