# Heads-up notification (HUN)

Notifications provide succinct and timely information about relevant events, such as phone calls or messages, along with actions the user can take in response.

Heads-up notifications (HUNs) show up to three actions users can take in response to the notification.

## Anatomy

In Android Auto, notifications have been designed for glanceability by reducing the content to the most essential elements. Whether a notification appears as a heads-up notification (HUN) or as a card in the Notification Center, each notification contains:

- An app icon identifying the app that sent the notification
- Primary and secondary text relating to the notification
- Up to 3 action buttons
- Avatar imagery (if applicable)
