# Parked and passenger apps

For non-driving scenarios, such as time spent waiting in a parked car or being a passenger, Android for Cars provides ways to bring existing tablet and browser apps to cars with Google built in.

App experiences such as video streaming, gaming, and browsing are well suited to times when drivers are waiting for their cars to charge or for a passenger to show up. As cars with multiple screens become more common, these experiences can keep passengers occupied as well.

If you have an existing app in another form factor, adapting it for use in cars is a relatively quick process. Guidelines for adapting video apps are available. Guidelines for other types of parked and passenger apps will be similar and are coming soon.
