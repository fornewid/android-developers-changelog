# Other driving-related apps

Android for Cars provides templates that let you create a variety of app experiences to aid driver journeys, from finding parking and charging options, to checking the weather, to communicating with home devices while on the road.

The Android for Cars App Library includes driving-optimized templates (some with maps, drawn by the app library), as well as templates with parked variants or a parked-only focus. By combining these templates in task flows, you can design experiences that work for both Android Auto and AAOS in a wide range of in-vehicle scenarios.

Currently, approved app categories for the Android for Cars App Library (other than the navigation category, discussed in[Navigation apps](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/app-types/navigation-apps)) include point-of-interest (such as parking and charging) and IoT.
