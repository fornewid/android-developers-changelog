# Branding elements like icons and colors help users to easily recognize your app. You'll need to provide an app icon and select an accent color to represent your brand wherever your content is visible.
| **Note:** You can add your app icon in your app's manifest declaration. Then set the accent color in the app theme (See[Customize the default theme](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/themes#CustomizeTheme)).
