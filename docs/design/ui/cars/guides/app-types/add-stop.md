# Add a stop while driving

You can let users add a stop while driving without losing the view of their current route. Transition from the[Navigation template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/navigation-template)to the[Map + Content template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/map-content-template)to show a compact list of places while keeping the turn-by-turn information visible.

The turn-by-turn information on the routing card will be condensed and moved to the side of the screen.

## Sample flow

The user is using the app. They decide to add a stop to their journey.
