# Media apps

Help users find their favorite songs, podcasts, and audiobooks easily while
keeping their eyes on the road. You can design end-to-end media experiences that
bring the best of your app to the car.

## Optimized for driving

Safety is key for any app that will be used while driving. Media experiences for
the car are optimized to minimize distraction, building on these main
principles:

- **Voice controls:** Let drivers complete tasks using their voice rather than button presses.
- **Brief task flows:** Keep task flows to 3 steps or fewer when possible.
- **Audio-only while driving:** [Video can distract drivers](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/app-cuj/parked-passenger-apps), so media apps are limited to audio-first content.

## Use templates to bring the best of your app to the car

Media templates provide guardrails to help you customize key components of your
app while relying on Google's auto industry expertise for the design foundations
and safety considerations.

If you use templates to create your app, you can customize the browsing
structure to suit your needs. Optional extra steps for templated apps include
creating a sign-in flow or settings for the car screen (for AAOS) using the
templates in the Android for Cars App Library.
