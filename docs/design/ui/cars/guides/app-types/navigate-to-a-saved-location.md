# Navigate to a saved location

You can keep task flows short by presenting location shortcuts in the landing screen of your navigation apps.

For example, if you include shortcuts such as*Home* and*Work*, users can start navigation with just one tap.

## Sample flow

This sample flow shows how the templates might look in Android Auto.
