# Android for Cars App Library

Android for Cars provides templates that let you create a variety of app experiences to aid driver journeys, from finding parking and charging options to communicating with home devices while on the road. You can find these templates in the[Android for Cars App Library (CAL)](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps).

It includes driving-optimized templates (some with maps, drawn by the app library), as well as templates with parked variants or a parked-only focus. By combining these templates in task flows, you can design experiences that work for both Android Auto and AAOS in a wide range of in-vehicle scenarios.

The approved app categories for the Android for Cars App Library (other than the navigation category, discussed in[Navigation apps](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/app-types/navigation-apps)) include point-of-interest (such as parking and charging) and IoT.

## Get started

To learn how to design apps with the templates in the Android for Cars App Library, see[Build apps with templates](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/overview).

Relevant templates include the following:

- [Grid template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/grid-template#requirements)
- [List template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/list-template#requirements)
- [Long Message template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/long-message-template#requirements)
- [Message template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/message-template#requirements)
- [Pane template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/pane-template#requirements)
- [Place List (map) template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/place-list-map-template#requirements)
- [Search template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/search-template#requirements)
- [Sign-In template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/sign-in-template#requirements)
- [Tab template](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/templates/tab-template#requirements)

| **Note:** For technical details about how to build apps with the Android for Cars App Library, see[Use the Android for Cars App Library](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps).

## Examples

To see how the templates can be assembled into a range of in-vehicle app experiences, check out the following sample flows:

- [Communicate with voice](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/ux-requirements/communicate-app-by-voice)
- [Grant permissions over car screen](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/flows/grant-permissions-in-car)
- [Grant permissions on phone](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/flows/grant-permissions-on-phone)
- [Refresh with button](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/sample-flows/refresh-with-button)
- [Respond to timed alert](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/app-types/timed-alert)
- [Search using past results](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/app-types/search-using-past-results)
- [Sign in while parked](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/flows/sign-in-while-parked)
- [View more list text when parked](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/sample-flows/view-more-list-text-parked)

### UX requirements

Apps need to meet the[global requirements for templated apps](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/ux-requirements/overview), as well as the requirements for their app category and for the[specific templates](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/cars/guides/ux-requirements/overview#templates)used in the task flows.
