Design for Driving

## Design Principles

By default, experiences built with Android for Cars adhere to the following tried-and-tested UX principles to help balance the user's visual, cognitive, and manual attention.

<br />

### Designed for the drive

Driving is the top priority for in-car apps. A simple user interface that is easy to navigate at a glance prevents distractions.

- While driving, only apps that can be used are available.
- Visual differences make it clear which apps can and can't be used while driving.

### Robust voice controls

Comprehensive voice controls help drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.

- Microphone stays visible when open
- Voice commands are available for frequent tasks

### Easy to pause and resume tasks

Drivers may get interrupted by something on the road as they look for a song or browse a list, but they should never lose progress.

- Drivers can easily continue tasks from where they left off.
- Reminders prompt drivers to resume their last task when it's safe to do so.

<br />

<br />

### Tasks are as short as possible

The number of taps required to complete a task should be kept as low as possible to help drivers focus on the road. Some systems temporarily restrict browsing to promote long glances back to the road to maintain good awareness of hazards.

- Drivers can complete common tasks in three taps or less.
- Shortcuts make it easy to navigate A-Z lists quickly.

<br />

### Readable at a glance

On-screen text needs to be brief and readable at a glance so drivers can keep their eyes on the road.

- Text shown while driving is kept to 1-3 lines and 120 characters to be glanceable
- Drivers can easily pick up where they left off.

### Helps drivers focus on driving

The user interface should adapt to the current driving state to help drivers focus on the road. This is important even in cases where partial automation is used.

- Notifications appear at carefully chosen locations and times.
- Notifications are suppressed when the driver is in the middle of a maneuver.
