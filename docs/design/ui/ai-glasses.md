### Audio AI Glasses

Use AI agents for hands-free, natural language interactions, offering proactive and reactive audio guidance for tasks like media control and navigation. Design for concise audio responses and text to speech. On audio glasses, the same app states can trigger different outputs like text-to-speech.![](http://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/glasses/glasses_landing_displayglasses.png)  

### Display AI Glasses

With a display, combine audio with subtle, glanceable visuals. These high-contrast, minimal visuals provide information like navigation or notifications, appearing only when relevant to enhance, not obstruct, the user's view. You can create your app on display AI glasses with unique interactions for the display.
