Glasses have multiple sources and types of interaction inputs, including hardware and touch, physical gesture, and voice.

## Hardware controls

Glasses controls can vary depending on device model, but most will include a camera button, touchpad, display button, and power switch or button. Hardware controls have default interactions, and some can be remapped for your app. Consider that inputs for glasses are more 1-dimensional, where users can make one control input at a time, compared to touchscreen inputs. The glasses hardware controls have default interaction mapping, some of which are handled by the app, and others that are handled by the system.

**The system will handle the following inputs:**

- Camera button single press to take photos and camera button hold to take videos
- Swiping with two fingers on the touchpad for volume
- Touch \& hold on the touchpad and the wake word on the microphone will launch Gemini
- System interprets swipe down on display glasses as system back.

**Your app has access to the glasses:**

- Microphone
- Point-of-View (POV) camera
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Camera button double-press
