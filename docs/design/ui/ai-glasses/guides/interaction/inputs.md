Glasses have multiple sources and types of interaction inputs, including
hardware and touch, physical gesture, and voice.

## Hardware controls

Glasses controls can vary depending on device model, but most will include a
camera button, touchpad, display button, and power switch or button. Hardware
controls have default interactions, and some can be remapped for your app.
Consider that inputs for glasses are more 1-dimensional, where users can make
one control input at a time, compared to touchscreen inputs. The glasses
hardware controls have default interaction mapping, some of which are handled by
the app, and others that are handled by the system.

**The system will handle the following inputs:**

- Camera button single press to take photos and camera button hold to take videos
- Swiping with two fingers on the touchpad for volume
- Touch \& hold on the touchpad and the wake word on the microphone will launch Gemini
- System interprets swipe down on display glasses as system back.

**Your app has access to the glasses:**

- Single-finger swipe on touchpad
- Microphone
- Point-of-View (POV) camera
- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Camera button double-press

## Usability principles

Use the following principles when designing for glasses inputs:

### Input interaction is quick \& discreet

Audio and display glasses are designed around short and quick gestures rather
than complex and
precise controls.

### Do

Design around fast gestures that don't feel out of place while a user is out and about. ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/glasses/guides/glasses_input_complex_dont.webp)

### Don't

Expect complex and precise gestures like those on mobile and desktop.

### Recognition rather than recall for display glasses

Limit the number of gestures that the user needs to remember, and take advantage
of existing user mental models.

### Do

Provide UI elements for users to complete actions when the display is available. ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/glasses/guides/glasses_input_recognition_dont.webp)

### Don't

Overly rely on users remembering gestures if the display is available.

### Always provide an immediate exit for users

A user should be able to exit an experience on their glasses at any point.

### Provide immediate, clear feedback about detected gesture and action taken

For audio glasses, both audio output and earcons are crucial for gesture
feedback. Earcons should be played immediately after a gesture, be audible, and
be distinct in various environments.

For display glasses, immediate visual feedback significantly enhances usability
due to the indirect interaction paradigm.

### Promote a smooth experience

Help users avoid mistakes by:

- Removing memory burdens
- Accounting for possible accidental slips
- Supporting undo actions
- Warning users before important actions

### Do

Put initial focus on a lower-cost action, like accepting a call. ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/glasses/guides/glasses_input_error_dont.webp)

### Don't

Put initial focus on high-cost actions, like declining a call.
