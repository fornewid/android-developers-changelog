When an app needs permissions to be granted the glasses, it should direct the user to the phone where a permissions dialog will display.

From there, follow permissions best practices for mobile:

- Prime the user, so they know why the permissions are asked and possible implications to features.
- Provide a way to update permissions preferences later.
