## Depth creates a sense of comfort and hierarchy

Depth on glasses is the combination of placement in z-space and shadows to establish a sense of hierarchy through varying levels of emphasis.

#### Use surface color variants to emphasize depth

Use surface color variants like Surface Container Low to create a more contrasting effect for depth. Shadows need to be fully opaque black to achieve effect.

### Don't

Use normal blend mode while designing as it will not give a realistic perception.
