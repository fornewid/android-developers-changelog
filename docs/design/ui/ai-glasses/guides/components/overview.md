Components are purpose built building blocks for building your UI. Your app should utilize Jetpack Compose Glimmer for components as they are optimized for the unique Glasses display use cases.

## Optimized components

**How were components optimized for transparent display?**

**Surface color**: The surface color of components is black to maximize contrast for card content.

**Outline \& Highlight**: The Outline color is optimized for contrast. The use of a highlight provides visual expression and might be used to indicate some types of input.

**Shape**: A softer shape system is used to improve glanceability by reducing the sharpness of corners and improving comfort.

**On Surface color**: The On Surface color of content is white or close to white to maximize contrast against surface.

**Typography**: The typography scale uses a small set of refined Body and Title styles that optimize kerning, size and weight for optimal readability \& legibility.

**Iconography**: The use of rounded Material Symbols coheres with the rounded typography scale.
