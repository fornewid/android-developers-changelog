Build your AI Glasses app using the Jetpack Compose Glimmer UI framework for augmented experiences that work across AI Glasses. Jetpack Compose Glimmer is one of the first UI frameworks to be optimized for transparent displays and the AI glasses form-factor.

## Transparent display first

Optimized, and backed by research and color science, for transparent displays and the glasses form factor for thoughtful, beautiful, optical see-through experiences.

## Hardware input

Interaction inputs are designed around the capabilities of AI glasses.

## Purpose-built

Styles and components are purpose-built to use out-of-the-box for AI glasses.

Jetpack Compose Glimmer is optimized for see-through displays and user comfort. While purpose built, it's not rigid. It provides a way for you to customize the focus highlights, in addition to type and color. This gives you control over your app's aesthetic, so you can define the GlimmerTheme that fits your brand.
