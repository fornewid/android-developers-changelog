# Design for Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR

Android XR works seamlessly with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR so you can build an app that's compatible across platforms. These XR development tools include features tailored to the unique challenges of creating immersive experiences. The[best choice](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/get-started#select-development)depends on your project requirements, target audience, and developer resources.

**Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR apps**

- Can port to Android XR from another platform with minimal development lift
- Are fully customizable and are alternatives to building with the[Jetpack XR SDK](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk)
- Only operate in Full Space, as they have access to and can use the entirety of a user's physical space

## Start with the technology and tools you are familiar with

Android XR supports open standards so you can create an app that's compatible with a wide range of devices and audiences. Select the development approach that suits your needs.

| ### Develop with Unity [Unity](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine)is a widely-used realtime 3D engine for creating interactive 2D and 3D content. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including a visual editor, scripting capabilities, and a large asset library. It provides prebuilt components, visual scripting, and a supportive community. Unity supports creative experimentation, quick iterations, and quality testing. [Develop with Unity](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity) | ### Develop with OpenXR [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/OpenXR/)is a royalty-free, open standard to build XR apps that are compatible across platforms and hardware. This lets you to write low-level code and create XR experiences that are accessible and adaptable to a wide range of devices. OpenXR offers improved performance due to closer-to-the-metal implementations and hardware optimizations. [Develop with OpenXR](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/openxr) | ### Develop with WebXR [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/)is an API that allows users to experience XR directly in a web browser, without having to download a special app. Anyone with a compatible browser can access WebXR experiences, potentially reaching a larger audience. Sharing WebXR experiences is as simple as sharing a URL. It's ideal for no-friction XR experiences that can run on a wide range of platforms.
