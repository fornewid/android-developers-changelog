Help users keep an eye on multiple workflows at once by supporting multi-tasking
features like picture-in-picture and multi-window.

## Picture-in-picture

Display picture-in-picture videos or video calls in the ample space of large
screen layouts. Provide a productive, pleasurable user experience with plenty of
room for viewing and doing at the same time.

## Multi-window

It's like two devices in one. Double device usability with side-by-side apps in
multi-window or multi-instance scenarios. Enable users to research while
writing, search while chatting, schedule while video calling.
