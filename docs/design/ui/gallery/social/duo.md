Google Duo sees increased engagement and improved ratings by optimizing for
larger screens

With the surge in stay-at-home activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Google
Duo team saw a significant increase in people using the app to stay connected
with friends and family, school and work. The team took the opportunity to
improve the user experience by optimizing the app layout on tablets and creating
a tabletop layout on foldables for hands-free video calling.
