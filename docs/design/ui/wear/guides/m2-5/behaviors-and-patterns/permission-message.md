# Permission messages

Apps may require specific user permissions, such as location access, to function properly. Because wearables are companions to mobile devices, you may need to accept permissions on the mobile device as well.

See the following examples of how to show users permission messages in different situations.

| **Note:** Wear OS uses runtime permissions to request permissions only at the moment a user needs to perform an action in an app.
