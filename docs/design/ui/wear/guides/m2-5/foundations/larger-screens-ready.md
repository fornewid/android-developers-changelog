## A minimum quality bar for experiences across all screen sizes on Wear OS

The**first**step in creating a great app for Wear OS is making your app ready for all screen sizes. This means testing your app across a range of target screen sizes and identifying and fixing any obvious bugs.

At this stage, your app's layout might not be ideal, but the app doesn't have obvious visual or interaction issues, and users can complete all task flows.
