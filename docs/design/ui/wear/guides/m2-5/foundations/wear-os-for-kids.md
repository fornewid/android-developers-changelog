# Design experiences for kids on Wear OS

Building apps and watch faces for kids requires a careful consideration of both the principles of Wear OS development, and the principles set forth on this page.

## Design principles for kids

Designing kids experiences for Wear OS requires consideration to keep kids safe and engaged with positive experiences. Keep the following design principles in mind:  

**Active and fun**   
Health and well-being  
Creativity  
Imagination  
Active participation  
Promoting active and enriching experiences focused on creativity, imagination, and well-being will offer the best possible experience for kids. Consider why and how your content can be best suited for a watch experience, and leverage Wear OS-specific affordances to make your content pop and spark delight.

<br />

**Design for Wearables**   
Short, engaging sessions  
Focus on quick fun tasks to avoid fatigue. Kids may find it hard and tiring to hold their wrists up for long periods of time. Limit interactions to seconds, and encourage kids to come back to them later.

<br />

**Build for All Kids**   
Customizable \& Personalizable  
Accessible for a range of abilities  
Wear OS for Kids is designed for younger audiences ranging from 6-18. Consider picking a smaller target age (for example, 6-8 or 9-12) to tailor your experience for, or make the application usable for, the whole age band.

## Content principles for kids

<br />

### Thoughtfully designed

Content is comprehensible and intuitive for kids in the target age band.

- **Words and sounds**: The words (text) and sounds are developmentally useful and comprehensible.
- **Interaction design**: The app is designed in an intuitive way that makes it easy for kids to use and navigate a Wear OS interface.
- **Art and animation**: The art and animation are high-quality and helps a user understand the app and/or adds delight.

### Don't

- Expect existing phone or tablet-based app experiences to be copy-and-paste ready for an experience on Wear OS.
- Rely on large amounts of text or excessive scrolling, especially for younger children.

- Require motor skills that are too difficult for your target age group.
- Cause frustration with unresponsive touch targets or non-intuitive placement of touch targets.
- Use poorly designed or distorted graphics.

## Appealing

Content is relevant and engaging for kids in the target age band.
