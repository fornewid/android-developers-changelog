# Selection controls are an important design component on Wear OS. The three most common selection controls are checkboxes, radio buttons, and switches.

Use each selection control in the following way:

- Checkboxes allow the selection of multiple options from a set.
- Radio buttons allow the selection of a single option from a set.
- Switches change a selection between on and off.

## Usage

Display selection controls within the screen's content area. Selection controls should appear inline, and near content where a user can take an action.
