# Overview

Material 3 Expressive is the latest design system for our smallest screen: the watch. Optimized for the round form factor, it brings a design update which emphasizes premium and a greater level of expression. Design and build beautiful and expressive watch apps with Material 3 Expressive.

## Expressive design principles

Expressive design elevates each UI layer with thoughtful shape, animation, color, and typography treatments.

### Embrace round

<br />

Material 3 Expressive introduces a shape framework designed for round screens. It uses the entire canvas to optimize glanceability and visual balance.

<br />

### Premium motion and springs

<br />

Material 3 Expressive updates make navigation feel natural, premium, and consistent across all transitions. Motion now spatially connects surfaces. They respond more accurately to user gestures, making navigation more intuitive.  

<br />

### Shape morphing

<br />

Material 3 Expressive introduces a shape morphing framework for lists and select buttons, optimized for a more premium feel. Lists feature smooth scrolling on a round form factor.  

<br />

### Rich color

<br />

The color system expands to adopt the deeper tonal palettes and wider token set included with Material 3 Expressive. The addition of a third accent color, along with more token variants and more specific color roles, brings both depth and variety to the design system.

<br />

### Variable fonts

<br />

Material 3 Expressive replaces all instances of Roboto with Roboto Flex. A baseline type scale is tailored and optimized for the watch's rounded screen.
