# Tier 2: Responsive and optimized

Apps that employ responsive layouts and automatically adapt to different screen sizes offer additional value to users and provide more productive, engaging user experiences.

Responsive layouts dynamically format and position elements such as buttons, text fields, and dialogs for an optimal user experience. Automatically offer users of your app additional value on larger screens by utilizing responsive design practices. Whether it's more text visible at a glance, more actions on screen, or larger, more accessible tap targets, responsive practices provide an enhanced experience for users of larger screens.

### Don't

- Increase the sizes of fonts, unless they're serving a primarily graphic purpose.
