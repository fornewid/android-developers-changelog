1.

   ## An Android developer is building an app that requires on-device text summarization to ensure user data remains private and the feature works offline. Which of the following would be the most suitable Android AI solution?

   Cloud-based generative AI with Firebase AI Logic SDK  
   On-device generative AI with ML Kit's GenAI APIs  
   Custom on-device ML with LiteRT for a highly specialized, pre-trained summarization model not offered by ML Kit  
   Generate images with Imagen 3  
2.

   ## What is the primary purpose of the Android AI Sample Catalog?

   To provide a comprehensive theoretical guide to all AI-ML concepts.  
   To offer pre-trained models for direct download and integration into production apps.  
   To showcase individual, self-contained examples demonstrating various generative AI capabilities on Android.  
   To serve as a platform for submitting and sharing custom AI models with the developer community.  
3.

   ## According to the provided learning pathway, what is a key use case for Imagen 3 in Android apps?

   Performing complex natural language understanding tasks.  
   Enabling on-device, real-time translation.  
   Generating custom avatars for user profiles or personalized visual assets.  
   Optimizing battery life through AI-powered resource management.  
4.

   ## An experienced Android developer wants to quickly implement features like barcode scanning and face detection without needing deep machine learning expertise. Which of the following provides ready-to-use, on-device APIs for these tasks?

   LiteRT  
   Firebase AI Logic SDK  
   ML Kit  
   Android AI Sample Catalog  
5.

   ## If an Android developer needs to deploy their own custom-trained machine learning model directly on an Android device, which technology is specifically mentioned in the learning pathway for this purpose?

   ML Kit's GenAI APIs  
   Imagen 3  
   LiteRT  
   Firebase AI Logic SDK
