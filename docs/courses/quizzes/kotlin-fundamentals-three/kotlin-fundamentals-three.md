   ## A ScrollView is a ViewGroup that can contain any number of Views or ViewGroups as its children. True or false?

   True.  
   False.

   ## For EditText views, it's not a good practice to provide hints because hints clutter the input field. True or false?

   True.  
   False.  
4.

   ## Which one of the following statements is true about Buttons?

   A Button is a ViewGroup.  
   You can only have a max of three Buttons per screen.  
   Buttons are clickable and, on click, the attached click listener performs an action.  
   Button is an extension of ImageView.  
5.

   ## In a ConstraintLayout, which of the following constraints are needed to position a view onscreen?

   Two horizontal constraints.  
   One vertical constraint.  
   At least one horizontal and one vertical constraint.  
   There is no need to constrain the view.  
6.

   ## The baseline constraint aligns the text baseline of a view to the text baseline of another view. True or false?

   True.  
   False.  
7.

   ## Why would you want to use data binding instead of calls to findViewById()?

   Code is shorter, easier to read, and maintain.  
   findViewById() runs on the main UI thread.  
   These calls can slow down the user interface.  
   Your app is less likely to crash.
