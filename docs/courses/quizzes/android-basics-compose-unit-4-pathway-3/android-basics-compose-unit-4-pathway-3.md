   ## Which of the following are true about designing for larger screens?

   Button positioning is more important on larger screen sizes.  
   Usually no changes are needed to the UI layout to make the app work well for larger screen sizes.  
   Adding another layout to the same screen removes the need to navigate between screens.  
   Large screen layouts should avoid placing commonly used buttons in the center of the screen.

   window class  
   layout point  
   size bucket

   `WindowSizeClass`  
6.

   ## A navigation rail is often appropriate for ___ width layouts.

   True  
   False  
9.

   ## Assume you have a contacts app that displays a list of contacts and has details to show for each contact. What are appropriate ways to adapt the UI to different screen sizes?

   Use the list-detail layout to show one pane or two panes side-by-side depending on the available width of the screen.  
   The list items should take up the full width of the screen, regardless of how narrow or wide the screen is.  
   The Up button should always be shown within the app and clicking the button should exit the app.  
   When rotating the device, the selected item in the list (and the corresponding details of that item shown) should be reset to the first item in the list.  
   It's required to use the Jetpack Navigation Component to make the UI responsive to different screen sizes.
