1.

   ## Which of the following statements are true about relational databases and SQLite?

   Choose as many answers as you see fit.  
   Referencing one table's primary key in another table lets you model relationships between tables.  
   A SQLite database consists of columns, which consist of tables and rows.  
   Every data table must have at least one foreign key.  
   Rows contain the individual items in the database.  
2.

   ## It is optional to end a SQL statement with a semicolon.

   True  
   False  
3.

   ## If you want to calculate the sum of all values for a database column, what do you use?

   Aggregate function  
   `WHERE clause`  
   `DISTINCT`keyword  
   `LIMIT`clause  
4.

   ## Which`SELECT`statement returns the number of unique email addresses for messages in the spam folder?

   `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT folder) FROM email WHERE spam != sender;`  
   `SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(sender) FROM email WHERE folder = 'spam';`  
   `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender) FROM email WHERE folder = 'spam';`  
   `SELECT DISTINCT COUNT('spam') FROM email WHERE sender = folder;`  
5.

   ## The SQL statement`SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE name LIKE '%Milton'`returns all rows where the value of the name column begins with`Milton`.

   True  
   False  
6.

   ## Which of the following statements are true about`GROUP BY`and`ORDER BY`?

   Choose as many answers as you see fit.  
   The`ORDER BY`clause comes before the`GROUP BY`clause.  
   In an`ORDER BY`clause, descending order is the default.  
   If a query contains a`GROUP BY`clause, it overrides the`ORDER BY`clause.  
   `ORDER BY`and`GROUP BY`clauses can both accept multiple columns.  
7.

   ## The`WHERE`condition`NOT read = false`and the`WHERE`condition`read != true`are equivalent.

   True  
   False  
8.

   ## The`LIMIT`clause`LIMIT 30 SKIP 60`returns:

   60 rows  
   Rows 31 through 60  
   Rows 61 through 90  
   90 rows  
9.

   ## An`UPDATE`statement uses a ___ clause to assign values for columns.

   `WHERE`  
   `SET`  
   `ASSIGN`  
   `LIKE`  
10.

    ## `UPDATE`and`DELETE`statements can include a`WHERE`clause and can affect multiple rows.

    True  
    False
