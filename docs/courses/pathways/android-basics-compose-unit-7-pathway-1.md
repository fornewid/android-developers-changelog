The WorkManager API for Android makes background work simple. WorkManager can create tasks that are queryable, reusable, and chainable. WorkManager is the recommended task scheduler on Android. This codelab teaches you the ins and outs of WorkManager: creating workers, using work requests, and chaining workers according to your app needs.
