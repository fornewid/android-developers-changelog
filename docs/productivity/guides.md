# About productivity apps

Productivity apps empower users to be more efficient and to unleash their creativity in areas as diverse as crafting business documents, managing schedules, creating comics, and designing social media thumbnails. In this developer center, you'll find resources to help you create, extend, and level up these types of experiences, making the most of the form factors and input capabilities of Android devices.

## Adaptive layouts

Make the most of devices with[large screens](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/support-different-display-sizes), such as tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS laptops, support[app continuity](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/learn-about-foldables#app_continuity)on foldables when transitioning between folded and unfolded states, and make your app fully[support multi-window modes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/multi-window-support).

## Leverage AI and machine learning

[On-device](https://developer.android.com/ai/aicore)and[cloud-based](https://developer.android.com/ai/vertex-ai-firebase)generative AI offer differentiating new ways to improve productivity. On-device models unlock generative AI in a privacy-preserving way while allowing for features such as text summarization, writing assistance, sentiment or mood analysis, and more on supported top-tier devices. Cloud solutions provide broad device support with powerful multimodal capabilities such as image and video descriptions, working with large documents, formatted responses and more.

## Work with hardware and accessories

Users can be more productive when using accessories like keyboards, mice, trackpads, and styluses, so supporting this hardware is key to empowering user productivity. Make sure to support keyboard navigation ([with views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/keyboard-input/navigation),[with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/focus))),[shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/keyboard-input/keyboard-shortcuts-helper)([with views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/keyboard-input/commands),[with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/keyboard-input/commands))), and alternative pointing devices such as mouse, trackpad, and stylus ([with views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/input-events),[with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/pointer-input))).

## Work with text and media

Editing text and working with media is a core function of many productivity apps, and you'll want to support core OS features that users expect, such as copy and paste ([with views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/copy-paste),[with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/copy-and-paste))), browsing user media with[photo picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker), support for emoji ([with views](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/learn-about-foldables#app_continuity),[with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/text/emoji))), and rich content interop with support for drag and drop and image keyboards ([with views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/drag-drop),[with Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/user-interactions/drag-and-drop))).
