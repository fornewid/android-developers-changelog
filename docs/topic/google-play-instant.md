# Google Play Instant

![](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/google-play-instant/images/gpi-logo.webp)  
**Warning:** Google Play Instant will no longer be available. Starting December 2025, Instant Apps cannot be published through Google Play, and all[Google Play services Instant APIs](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/instantapps/package-summary)will no longer work. Users will no longer be served Instant Apps by Play using any mechanism.

We're making this change based on developer feedback and our continuous investments to improve the ecosystem since the introduction of Google Play Instant.

To continue optimizing for user growth, we encourage developers to refer users to their regular app or game, using[deeplinks](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12463044)to redirect them to specific journeys or features when relevant.

**Native Android apps, without the installation**   
With Google Play Instant, people can use an app or game without installing it first. Increase engagement with your Android app or gain more installs by surfacing your instant app across the Play Store and Google Play Games app.

Android's new app publishing format, the[Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle), makes it easier than ever to offer a Google Play Instant experience. Starting from the Android Studio 3.3 beta release, you can build and publish one app bundle artifact to Google Play containing both instant and feature modules. Build instant games easily with Cocos and Unity plug-ins.

Google Play Instant is open to all app and game developers.
