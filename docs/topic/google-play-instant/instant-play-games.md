**Warning:** Google Play Instant will no longer be available. Starting December 2025,
Instant Apps cannot be published through Google Play, and all
[Google Play services Instant APIs](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/instantapps/package-summary)
will no longer work. Users will no longer be served Instant Apps by Play using any
mechanism.

We're making this change based on developer feedback and our continuous investments
to improve the ecosystem since the introduction of Google Play Instant.

To continue optimizing for user growth, we encourage developers to refer users to
their regular app or game, using [deeplinks](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12463044)
to redirect them to specific journeys or features when relevant.

Full games that are packaged using Google Play Instant are being
featured prominently on the homepage of the [Google Play Games app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.play.games). These
instant games are full experience games, not trial versions. Players tap on the
**Instant play** button to play the full game without needing to install it
first.

The Google Play Games app is a highly visible surface with hundreds of millions
of active users globally. This program has been a great opportunity for
developers of small-file size games to grow their audience and business by
packaging their full game using Google Play Instant (with support for
in-app purchases and ads monetization).

While all developers have been able to create Google Play Instant games,
the Google Play team has final discretion over which games are featured on
the homepage of the Google Play Games app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** We are not accepting new Instant Game submissions for featuring in the Play Games app. However, Instant Games that have already been approved for featuring on the Play Games app will continue to run as normal.

## Benefits of the Instant play program

The following are some of the key benefits of the Google Play Instant
program:

1. **Increased discoverability**

   Instant play games are eligible for featuring on the
   homepage of the Google Play Games app, which is an additive surface to the
   Play Store.
2. **More players**

   If users don't have to worry about installs, they are more likely to jump
   into your game.
3. **Monetization**

   In-app purchase (IAP) \& ads are supported.
4. **A high quality experience**

   Everything "just works" when users tap to Instant play.

## Requirements

In order to remain eligible for featuring in the Google Play Games app, your Google Play Instant game will be reviewed for the following:

- Technical excellence: The game must meet a high standard of technical excellence and provide a reliable experience to users in compliance with the program requirements.
- User-friendly experience: The game is fun and engaging. Key details are correct: the back button works to exit the game, user progress is saved seamlessly, and new users understand the gameplay easily.
- Wide appeal: The game must be accessible to a large audience of users as selected by our editors. Gentle learning curves help games reach larger audiences.
- Tasteful monetization: The game must be monetized in tasteful and
  non-disruptive ways. Monetization requirements include the following:

  - Make sure banner ads are unobtrusive to gameplay.
  - Place ads at natural breaks in the gameplay in between page content, levels, or stages. Don't overwhelm users with ads. Repeated ads often lead to poor user experiences and accidental clicks.
  - Pre-roll ads that are shown before the game is played need to be skippable after a maximum of 5 seconds.
  - Ads must not be disguised as in-game components or elements of menu/ game navigation.
  - Consider making an in-app-purchase available for users.
  - Cross-promotion to other games is acceptable, subject to the preceding ads requirements. Do not prompt users to install cross-promoted games.
