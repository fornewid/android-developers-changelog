The role of the UI is to display the application data on the screen.
The UI also serves as the primary point of user interaction.
Whenever the data changes,
either due to user interaction (like pressing a button) or external input (like
a network response), the UI updates to reflect those changes.
*Effectively, the UI is a visual representation of the application state as
retrieved from the data layer.*

However, the application data you get from the data layer is usually in a
different format than the information you need to display. For example, you
might only need part of the data for the UI, or you might need to merge two
different data sources to present information that is relevant to the user.
Regardless of the logic you apply, you need to pass the UI all the information
it needs to render fully. *The UI layer is the pipeline that converts
application data changes to a form that the UI can present, and then displays
it.*
![In a typical architecture, the UI layer's UI elements depend on state
holders, which in turn depend on classes from either the data layer or the
optional domain layer.](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-ui-overview.png) **Figure 1.** The UI layer's role in app architecture.

## A basic case study

Consider an app that fetches news articles for a user to read. The app has an
articles screen that presents articles available to read, and also lets
signed-in users bookmark articles that really stand out. Given that there might
be a lot of articles at any time, the reader must be able to browse
articles by category. In summary, the app lets users do the following:

- View articles available to read.
- Browse articles by category.
- Sign in and bookmark certain articles.
- Access some premium features if eligible.

![A sample news app showing article previews, one of which is bookmarked.](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-ui-basic-case-study.png) **Figure 2.** A sample news app for a UI case study.

The following sections use this example as a case study to introduce the
principles of unidirectional data flow, as well as illustrating the problems
that these principles help solve in the context of app architecture for the UI
layer.

## UI layer architecture

The term *UI* refers to UI elements such as containers and composable functions
that display data. For building Android UIs,
[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) is the recommended toolkit.
Because the role of the [data
layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/data-layer) is to hold, manage, and provide access to the
app data, the UI layer must perform the following steps:

1. Consume app data and transform it into data the UI can easily render.
2. Consume UI-renderable data and transform it into UI elements for presentation to the user.
3. Consume user input events from those assembled UI elements and reflect their effects in the UI data as needed.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for as long as necessary.

The rest of this guide demonstrates how to implement a UI layer that performs
these steps. In particular, this guide covers the following tasks and concepts:

- How to define the UI state
- Unidirectional data flow (UDF) as a means of producing and managing the UI state
- How to expose UI state with observable data types according to UDF principles
- How to implement a UI that consumes the observable UI state

The most fundamental of these is the definition of the UI state.

## Define UI state

In the [case study](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#case-study) outlined earlier, the UI shows
a list of articles along with some metadata for each article. This information
that the app presents to the user is the UI state.

In other words, if the UI is what the user sees, the UI state is what the app
says they should see. Like two sides of the same coin, the UI is the visual
representation of the UI state. Any changes to the UI state are immediately
reflected in the UI.
![UI is a result of binding UI elements on the screen with the UI state.](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-ui-elements-state.png) **Figure 3.** UI is a result of binding UI elements on the screen with the UI state.

Consider the case study: to fulfill the News app's requirements, the
information required to fully render the UI can be encapsulated in a
`NewsUiState` data class defined as follows:

    data class NewsUiState(
        val isSignedIn: Boolean = false,
        val isPremium: Boolean = false,
        val newsItems: List<NewsItemUiState> = listOf(),
        val userMessages: List<Message> = listOf()
    )

    data class NewsItemUiState(
        val title: String,
        val body: String,
        val bookmarked: Boolean = false,
        ...
    )

For more information on UI state,
see [State and Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/state).

### Immutability

The UI state definition in the previous example is immutable. The key benefit of
this is that immutable objects provide guarantees regarding the state of the
application at an instant in time. This frees up the UI to focus on its primary
role: to read the state and update its UI elements accordingly.
Never modify the UI state in the UI directly unless the UI itself is the
sole source of its data. Violating this principle results in multiple sources of
truth for the same piece of information, leading to data inconsistencies and
subtle bugs.

For example, consider the earlier case study.
If the `bookmarked` flag in a `NewsItemUiState` object from the UI
state is updated in the `Activity` class, that flag
competes with the data layer as the source of the bookmarked status of an
article. Immutable data classes are very useful for preventing this kind of
inconsistency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Point:** Only sources or owners of data should be responsible for updating the data they expose.

### Naming conventions in this guide

In this guide, UI state classes are named based on the functionality of the
screen or part of the screen they describe. The convention is as follows:

*functionality* + *UiState*.

For example, the state of a screen displaying news might be called
`NewsUiState`, and the state of a news item in a list of news items might be a
`NewsItemUiState`.

## Manage state with Unidirectional Data Flow

The previous section established that the UI state is an immutable snapshot of
the details needed for the UI to render. However, the dynamic nature of data in
apps means that state can change over time. This might be due to user
interaction or other events that modify the underlying data that is used to
populate the app.

These interactions can benefit from a mediator to process them, defining the
logic to be applied to each event and transforming the backing data sources
to create UI state. Although these interactions and
their logic can be housed in the UI itself, this can quickly get unwieldy as
the UI takes on too much responsibility.
Furthermore, this can affect testability
because the resulting code is tightly coupled.
Unless the UI state is very simple, make sure the UI's sole responsibility is
to consume and display UI state.

This section discusses Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF), an architecture pattern
that helps enforce this healthy separation of responsibility.

### State holders

State holders are the classes responsible for producing UI state and for the
logic needed to produce that state.
State holders come in various sizes depending on the scope of the corresponding
UI elements that they manage, ranging from a single widget like a
[bottom app bar](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/app-bars#bottom) to a whole screen or a navigation destination.

In the latter case, the typical implementation is an instance of a
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), although depending on the
requirements of the application, a simple class might suffice. The News app from
the [case study](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#case-study), for example, uses a `NewsViewModel` class as a
state holder to produce the UI state for the screen displayed in that section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Point:** The [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) type is the recommended implementation for the management of screen-level UI state with access to the data layer. Furthermore, it survives configuration changes automatically. `ViewModel` classes define the logic to be applied to events in the app and produce updated state as a result.

There are many ways to model the codependency between the UI and its state
producer. However, because the interaction between the UI and its `ViewModel`
class can largely be understood as event *input* and its ensuing state *output*,
the relationship can be represented as shown in the following diagram:
![Application data flows from the data layer to the ViewModel. UI state
flows from the ViewModel to the UI elements, and events flow from the UI
elements back to the ViewModel.](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-ui-udf.png) **Figure 4.** Diagram of how UDF works in app architecture.

The pattern where the state flows down and the events flow up is called a
unidirectional data flow (UDF). The implications of this pattern for app
architecture are as follows:

- The ViewModel holds and exposes the state to be consumed by the UI. The UI state is application data transformed by the ViewModel.
- The UI notifies the ViewModel of user events.
- The ViewModel handles the user actions and updates the state.
- The updated state is fed back to the UI to render.
- The above is repeated for any event that causes a mutation of state.

For navigation destinations or screens, the ViewModel works with repositories or
use case classes to get data and transform it into the UI state while
incorporating the effects of events that may cause mutations of the state. The
[case study](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#case-study) mentioned earlier contains a list of articles, each
having a title, description, source, author name, publication date, and whether
it was bookmarked. The UI for each article item looks like this:
![A single article item from the case study app. The UI shows a thumbnail, the article title, the author, the estimated reading time for the article, and a bookmark icon.](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-ui-basic-case-study-item.png) **Figure 5.** UI of an article item in the case study app.

A user requesting to bookmark an article is an example of an event that can
cause state mutations. As the state producer, it's the ViewModel's
responsibility to define all the logic required to populate all fields
in the UI state and process the events needed for the UI to render fully.
![A UI event occurs when the user bookmarks an artcile. The ViewModel
notifies the data layer of the state change. The data layer persists the
data change and updates the application data. The new app data with the
bookmarked article is passed up to the ViewModel, which then produces the
new UI state and passes it to the UI elements for display.](https://developer.android.com/static/topic/libraries/architecture/images/mad-arch-ui-udf-in-action.png) **Figure 6.** Diagram illustrating the cycle of events and data in UDF.

The following sections take a closer look at the events that cause state changes
and how they can be processed using UDF.

### Types of logic

Bookmarking an article is an example of *business logic* because it gives value
to your app. To learn more about this, see the [data
layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/data-layer) page. However, there are different types of
logic that are important to define:

- **Business logic** is the implementation of product requirements for app data. As mentioned already, one example is bookmarking an article in the case study app. Business logic is usually placed in the domain or data layers, but never in the UI layer.
- **UI behavior logic** or **UI logic** is *how* to display state changes on the screen. Examples include obtaining the right text to show on the screen using Android [`Resources`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources), navigating to a particular screen when the user clicks a button, or displaying a user message on the screen using a [toast](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts) or a [snackbar](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/snackbar).

Keep UI logic in the UI, not in the ViewModel, particularly when it involves
UI types like [`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context).
If the UI grows in complexity and you want to delegate the UI
logic to another class to favor testability and separation of concerns, **you
can create a simple class as a state holder**. Simple classes created in the UI
can take Android SDK dependencies because they follow the lifecycle of the UI;
ViewModel objects have a longer lifespan.

For more information about state holders and how they fit into the context of
helping build UI, see the [Jetpack Compose State
guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#managing-state).

### Why use UDF?

UDF models the cycle of state production as shown in Figure 4. It also separates
the place where state changes originate, the place where they are transformed,
and the place where they are finally consumed. This separation lets the UI do
exactly what its name implies: display information by observing state changes,
and relay user intent by passing those changes on to the ViewModel.

In other words, UDF allows for the following:

- **Data consistency.** There is a single source of truth for the UI.
- **Testability.** The source of state is isolated and therefore testable independent of the UI.
- **Maintainability.** Mutation of state follows a well-defined pattern where mutations are a result of both user events and the sources of data they pull from.

## Expose UI state

After you define your UI state and determine how you will manage the production
of that state, the next step is to present the produced state to the UI.

When using UDF to manage the production of state, you can consider the
produced state to be a stream---in other words, multiple versions of the state
are produced over time. Expose the UI state in an
observable data holder like `StateFlow`. This lets the UI react to any changes
made in the state without having to manually pull data directly from the
ViewModel. This also has the
benefit of always having the latest version of the UI state cached, which is
useful for quick state restoration after configuration changes.

    class NewsViewModel(...) : ViewModel() {

        val uiState: NewsUiState = ...
    }

For an introduction to Kotlin flows, see [Kotlin flows on Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow).
To learn how to use `StateFlow` as an observable data holder,
see the
[Advanced State and Side Effects in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-advanced-state-side-effects) codelab.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** In Jetpack Compose apps, you can use Compose's observable [State
> APIs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#state-in-composables) such as `mutableStateOf` or `snapshotFlow` for the exposure of UI state. Any type of observable data holder such as `StateFlow` that you see in this guide can be consumed in Compose using the appropriate [extensions](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#streams).

In cases where the data exposed to the UI is relatively simple, it's often worth
wrapping the data in a UI state type because it conveys the relationship between
the emission of the state holder and its associated screen or UI element.
As the UI element grows more complex, it's straightforward to add to
the definition of the UI state, so you can accommodate the extra information
needed to render the UI element.

A common way of creating a stream of `UiState` is by exposing a `mutableStateOf`
property with a `private set`, keeping the state mutable inside the ViewModel
but read-only for the UI.

    class NewsViewModel(...) : ViewModel() {

        var uiState by mutableStateOf(NewsUiState())
            private set

        ...
    }

The ViewModel can then expose methods that internally mutate the state,
publishing updates for the UI to consume. Take, for example, the case where
you need to perform an asynchronous action.
You can launch a coroutine using the [`viewModelScope`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#viewmodelscope),
and then update the mutable state upon completion.

    class NewsViewModel(
        private val repository: NewsRepository,
        ...
    ) : ViewModel() {

        var uiState by mutableStateOf(NewsUiState())
            private set

        private var fetchJob: Job? = null

        fun fetchArticles(category: String) {
            fetchJob?.cancel()
            fetchJob = viewModelScope.launch {
                try {
                    val newsItems = repository.newsItemsForCategory(category)
                    uiState = uiState.copy(newsItems = newsItems)
                } catch (ioe: IOException) {
                    // Handle the error and notify the UI when appropriate.
                    val messages = getMessagesFromThrowable(ioe)
                    uiState = uiState.copy(userMessages = messages)
                }
            }
        }
    }

In the preceding example, the `NewsViewModel` class attempts to fetch articles
for a certain category and then reflects the result of the attempt---whether
success or
failure---in the UI state, where the UI can react to it appropriately.
For more information about error handling, see the
[Show errors on the screen](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#show-errors) section.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The pattern shown in the previous example, where state is mutated through functions on the ViewModel, is one of the more popular implementations of unidirectional data flow.

### Additional considerations

In addition to the previous guidance, consider the following when exposing UI
state:

- **Use a single UI state object to handle states that
  are related to each other.**
  This leads to fewer inconsistencies and it makes the code easier to
  understand. If you expose the list of news items and the number of bookmarks
  in two different streams, you might end up in a situation where one was
  updated and the other was not. When you use a single stream, both elements are
  kept up to date. Furthermore, some business logic may require a combination of
  sources. For example, you might need to show a bookmark button only if the
  user is signed in *and* that user is a subscriber to a premium news service.
  You can define a UI state class as follows:

      data class NewsUiState(
          val isSignedIn: Boolean = false,
          val isPremium: Boolean = false,
          val newsItems: List<NewsItemUiState> = listOf()
      )

      val NewsUiState.canBookmarkNews: Boolean get() = isSignedIn && isPremium

  In this declaration, the visibility of the bookmark button is a derived
  property of two other properties. As business logic gets more complex, having
  a singular `UiState` class where all properties are immediately available
  becomes increasingly important.
- **UI states: single stream or multiple streams?** The key guiding principle
  for choosing between exposing UI state in a single stream or in multiple
  streams is the relationship between the items
  emitted. The biggest advantages of a single-stream exposure are
  convenience and
  data consistency: consumers of state always have the latest information
  available at any given time. However, there are instances where separate
  streams of state from the ViewModel might be appropriate:

  - **Unrelated data types:** Some states that are needed to render the UI might
    be completely independent from each other. In such cases, the costs of
    bundling these disparate states together might outweigh the benefits,
    especially if one of these states updates more frequently than the other.

  - **`UiState` diffing:** The more fields there are in a `UiState` object, the
    more likely it is that the stream emits as a result of one of its fields
    being updated. Because UI elements don't have a diffing mechanism to
    understand
    whether consecutive emissions are different or the same, every emission
    causes an update to the UI element. This means that mitigation using
    `Flow` API methods like [`distinctUntilChanged()`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/distinct-until-changed.html) might be
    necessary.

For more information about rendering and the UI state,
see [Lifecycle of composables](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lifecycle).

## Consume UI state

To consume the stream of `UiState` objects in the UI, use the terminal
operator for the observable data type that you're using. For example,
for Kotlin flows use the `collect()` method or its variations.

When consuming observable data holders in the UI, make sure to consider the
lifecycle of the UI. Don't make the UI observe the UI state when the composable
isn't being displayed to the user. To learn more about this topic, see this
[blog post](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/consuming-flows-safely-in-jetpack-compose-cde014d0d5a3). When using flows, it's best to handle lifecycle concerns with
the appropriate coroutine scope and the `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` API:


```kotlin
@Composable
private fun ConversationScreen(
    conversationViewModel: ConversationViewModel = viewModel()
) {

    val messages by conversationViewModel.messages.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()

    ConversationScreen(
        messages = messages,
        onSendMessage = { message: Message -> conversationViewModel.sendMessage(message) }
    )
}

@Composable
private fun ConversationScreen(
    messages: List<Message>,
    onSendMessage: (Message) -> Unit
) {

    MessagesList(messages, onSendMessage)
    /* ... */
}
```

<br />

### Show in-progress operations

A simple way to represent loading states in a `UiState` class is with a
boolean field:

    data class NewsUiState(
        val isFetchingArticles: Boolean = false,
        ...
    )

This flag's value represents the presence or absence of a progress bar in the
UI.

    @Composable
    fun LatestNewsScreen(
        modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
        viewModel: NewsViewModel = viewModel()
    ) {
        Box(modifier.fillMaxSize()) {

            if (viewModel.uiState.isFetchingArticles) {
                CircularProgressIndicator(Modifier.align(Alignment.Center))
            }

            // Add other UI elements. For example, the list.
        }
    }

### Show errors on the screen

Showing errors in the UI is similar to showing in-progress operations because
they are both easily represented by boolean values that denote their presence or
absence. However, errors might also include an associated message to relay back
to the user, or an action associated with them that retries the failed
operation. Therefore, while an in-progress operation is either loading or not
loading, error states might need to be modeled with data classes that host the
metadata appropriate for the context of the error.

Consider the previous example that showed a
progress bar while fetching articles. If this operation results in an error, you
might want to display one or more messages to the user detailing what went
wrong.

    data class Message(val id: Long, val message: String)

    data class NewsUiState(
        val userMessages: List<Message> = listOf(),
        ...
    )

You might then present the error messages to the user in the form of UI
elements like [snackbars](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/components/snackbar).
For more information on how UI events are produced and consumed, see [UI
events](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/ui-layer/events).

## Threading and concurrency

Make sure all work performed in a ViewModel is *main-safe*---safe to call from the
main thread. The data and domain layers are responsible for
moving work to a different thread.

If a ViewModel performs long-running operations, then it is also responsible for
moving that logic to a background thread. Kotlin coroutines are a great way to
manage concurrent operations, and the Jetpack Architecture Components provide
built-in support for them. To learn more about using coroutines in Android apps,
see [Kotlin coroutines on Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines).

## Navigation

Changes in app navigation are often driven by event-like emissions. For example,
after a `SignInViewModel` class performs a sign-in, the `UiState` might have an
`isSignedIn` field set to `true`. Consume triggers like these just
like the ones covered in the earlier [Consume UI state](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#consume-ui-state) section,
but defer the consumption implementation to the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation).

For more information about UI navigation,
see [Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3).

## Paging

The [Paging library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) is
consumed in the UI with a type called `PagingData`. Because `PagingData`
represents and contains items that can change over time---in other words, it is
not an immutable type---do not represent it in an immutable UI state.
Instead, expose it from the ViewModel independently in its own
stream.

The following example shows the Paging library's Compose API:


```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen(flow: Flow<PagingData<String>>) {
    val lazyPagingItems = flow.collectAsLazyPagingItems()
    LazyColumn {
        items(
            lazyPagingItems.itemCount,
            key = lazyPagingItems.itemKey { it }
        ) { index ->
            val item = lazyPagingItems[index]
            Text("Item is $item")
        }
    }
}
```

<br />

## Animations

In order to provide smooth top-level navigation transitions,
you might want to wait for the second screen to load data before starting
the animation.

For more information on navigation transitions,
see [Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3/animate-destinations) and
[Shared element transitions in Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/shared-elements).
