If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.

### 3. SDK License from Google

3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose. 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights.

You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.

### 4. Use of the SDK by You

4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

### 5. Your Developer Credentials

5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.

### 6. Privacy and Information

6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL: https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be shared with Google partners to improve the SDK.

### 7. Third Party Applications

7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

### 8. Using Android APIs

8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService>, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL: <https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/>, as updated from time to time.

## Android Gradle
plugin and Android Studio compatibility

The Android Studio build system is based on Gradle, and the Android Gradle
plugin (AGP) adds several features that are specific to building Android apps. The
following table lists which version of AGP is required for each version of
Android Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> There is now a time-based compatibility policy for AGP and Android Studio. Each Android Studio version will support AGP versions released within the previous 3 years. AGP versions older than 3 years will no longer be supported in newer Android Studio versions. If your project's AGP version is incompatible, Android Studio will require you to update AGP.

> [!NOTE]
> If your project is not supported by a specific version of Android Studio, you can still open and update your project using an [older version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive).

| Android Studio version | Required AGP version |
|---|---|
| Panda 1 \| 2025.3.1 | 4.0-9.0 |

## Minimum versions of tools for Android API level

There are minimum versions of Android Studio and AGP that support a specific API
level. Using lower versions of Android Studio or AGP than required by your
project's `targetSdk` or `compileSdk` could lead to unexpected issues. We
recommend using the latest preview version of Android Studio and AGP to work on
projects that target preview versions of the Android OS. You can
[install
preview versions of Android Studio alongside a stable version](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/install-preview#install_alongside_your_stable_version).

The minimum versions of Android Studio and AGP are as follows:

| API level | Minimum Android Studio version | Minimum AGP version |
|---|---|---|
| 36.1 | Narwhal 3 Feature Drop \| 2025.1.3 | 8.13.0 |
| 36.0 | Meerkat \| 2024.3.1 Patch 1 | 8.9.1 |
| 35 | Koala Feature Drop \| 2024.2.1 | 8.6.0 |
| 34 | Hedgehog \| 2023.1.1 | 8.1.1 |
| 33 | Flamingo \| 2022.2.1 | 7.2 |

<br />


## Android Studio and Cloud services compatibility

Android Studio includes service integrations that help you and your team make
faster progress as you develop, release, and maintain Android apps. This
includes Cloud services such as Gemini in Android Studio, Play Vitals, and
Firebase Crashlytics. Cloud services are only available on the latest stable
channel version of Android Studio and major versions (including their patches)
released in the previous 10 months. When a version falls outside of that
compatibility window, service integrations become disabled and you are required
to update Android Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> This Cloud services compatibility policy is being announced with the stable channel release of Android Studio Meerkat Feature Drop. Enforcement will begin with the stable channel release of Android Studio Narwhal Feature Drop, which will fall out of the compatibility window in Q2 of 2026.

### Android Studio versions that are currently
compatible with Cloud services

As of the stable channel release of Android Studio Meerkat Feature Drop, all
versions of Studio are compatible with Cloud services. Enforcement will begin
with Android Studio Narwhal Feature Drop.

## Studio Labs

Studio Labs lets you try out the latest AI experimental features in a stable
version of Android Studio, so you can more quickly integrate our AI assistance
offerings in your development workflow. For more information, see
[Studio Labs](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/labs).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Studio Labs is accessible in RC and stable releases starting with Android Studio Narwhal. In the corresponding canary versions of Android Studio, the features are enabled by default.

The following are features currently available in Studio Labs.

| Feature | Description | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Compose preview generation | Gemini can automatically generate Compose previews, including mock data for preview parameters, for a specific composable or all composables in a file. | [Generate Compose previews](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/generate-compose-previews) |
| Transform UI | Use natural language to update your app UI directly from the Compose preview panel. | [Transform UI](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/transform-ui) |
| Journeys for Android Studio | Use natural language to describe steps and assertions for end-to-end tests. | [Journeys for Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/journeys) |

The following are new features in Android Studio Panda 1.

## Simplified JDK management with Gradle Daemon JVM Criteria

To simplify JDK management for Gradle builds, Android Studio now uses
[Gradle Daemon JVM criteria](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:configuring_daemon_jvm)
by default for new projects. This feature lets Gradle [auto-detect](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection)
compatible JDK for your project installed in your machine to execute Gradle
builds or [auto-provision](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:provisioning)
the required JDK by downloading it if it cannot be found locally. This feature was
stabilized in [Gradle 9.2.0](https://docs.gradle.org/9.2.0/release-notes.html).

This simplifies project setup and improves JDK management in several ways:

- **Fewer setup errors**: You no longer need to have a specific JDK installed to import and build a project, which reduces setup-related errors given invalid JDK selection.
- **Consistent builds**: JDK selection for Gradle builds is not only consistent across different machines but also between the IDE and command-line, which prevents spawning multiple Gradle Daemons that adversely affect performance.

For existing projects that use a compatible Gradle version, Android Studio
shows a notification offering an option to automatically migrate your project's
defined [Gradle JDK configuration](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks#jdk-config-in-studio) to
Daemon JVM criteria, while maintaining the same specifications.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The project Daemon JVM criteria represents a replacement for the old Gradle JDK configuration and can be modified from **File** (**Android Studio** on macOS) **\> Settings \> Build, Execution, Deployment \> Build Tools \> Gradle**.
