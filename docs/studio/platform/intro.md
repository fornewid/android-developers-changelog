# Meet Android Studio for Platform

Android Studio for Platform (ASfP) is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for Android platform development. Built on the powerful foundation of IntelliJ IDEA, ASfP is tailored to enhance productivity and streamline workflows for engineers working within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).

## Why use ASfP?

ASfP provides a comprehensive suite of tools optimized for the unique challenges of platform development, going beyond standard Android app development. It integrates deeply with the AOSP codebase and build systems, offering features that accelerate your development process.

## Key features

- **Seamless AOSP integration:** Works directly with the AOSP source tree and the Soong build system (`Android.bp`files). Effortlessly sync and manage complex platform projects.

- **Intelligent code editing:**Benefit from advanced code completion, refactoring, and analysis for Kotlin, Java, C/C++, and Rust, helping you write high-quality code faster.

- **Powerful debugging:** Debug platform code, including C/C++ and Java, with features like breakpoints, variable inspection, and expression evaluation. Learn more about[debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/platform/debug).

- **Integrated testing:** Run`atest`commands directly from the IDE to execute platform tests and view results. See[Test your platform code](https://developer.android.com/studio/platform/test).

- **Customizable project setup:** Fine-tune your project scope and build configurations using the flexible`.asfp-project`YAML file. Learn more about[project management](https://developer.android.com/studio/platform/projects).

- **Rust language support:** Core feature support for Rust development in AOSP. More details at[Rust Support in ASfP](https://developer.android.com/studio/platform/projects/rust).

- **AI-powered assistance:** Use[Gemini in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/gemini-in-android)for code generation, code updates, and to get answers to your development questions, all within the editor.
