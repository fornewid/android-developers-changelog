# Run the standalone profiler

The standalone Android Studio profiler lets you[profile your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile)without running the full Android Studio IDE.

To run the standalone profiler, do the following:

1. Make sure the profiler is not currently running inside of Android Studio.
2. Go to the installation directory and navigate to the`bin`directory:

   **Windows/Linux** :<var translate="no">studio-installation-folder</var>`/bin`

   **macOS**: The use of standalone profilers is not supported on macOS.
3. Depending on your OS, run`profiler.exe`or`profiler.sh`. The Android Studio splash screen appears. After the splash screen disappears, a profiler window opens.
