# Get started with Gemini in Android Studio

![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/gemini/images/gemini-onboarding.png)

To get started with Gemini in Android Studio, follow these steps:

1. [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Note that some features are under active development and only available through[Studio Labs](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/labs)or a[preview version of Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview). See[Features](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/features)to check what version of Android Studio you need for the features you're interested in using.
2. To launch Gemini, open or start an Android Studio project and click**Gemini** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/gemini-icon.png). Alternatively, click**View \> Tool Windows \> Gemini**.
3. Sign in to your Google Account when asked, if you aren't already signed in.
4. Complete the onboarding flow.
   1. Select**Gemini for individuals**when given the choice of product tier.
   2. For the best results, select**Use all Gemini features** to allow project context sharing. By default, this setting applies to all projects that you use Gemini for. To update the setting or request to configure context sharing on a per project basis, go to the[Gemini settings](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/configure-gemini).

After completing these steps, the chat box appears and you can start using Gemini. At any time, you can quickly check whether Gemini is enabled by checking the Gemini icon at the bottom of the Studio IDE:

- If Gemini is enabled, you should see**Gemini: Active** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/gemini/images/gemini-active.png).
- If Gemini is disabled, most likely because you're signed out, you should see**Gemini: Inactive** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/gemini/images/gemini-inactive.png).

You can also click on the icon to shortcut to[Gemini's settings](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/configure-gemini).
