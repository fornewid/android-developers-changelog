# Generate documentation for your code

You can use Gemini in Android Studio to generate documentation for your code. Generate clear and concise documentation for your code with instant drafts that you can refine and perfect.

1. In the section of code that you want to document, right-click and select**Gemini \> Document Function** from the context menu. (You might also see**Document Class** or**Document Property**depending on the context.)
2. Review proposed changes in the code diff. Refine if necessary before you click**Accept changes**.
