# Chat with Gemini

| **Tip:** Starting with Android Studio Narwhal Feature Drop, Gemini in Android Studio has[Agent Mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/agent-mode). Agent Mode can handle complex tasks that span multiple steps and files, going beyond what you can do with chat alone.

The main interface for interacting with Gemini is the chat window. You can use it to ask questions ranging from very open-ended ones to specific problems that you need help with.

Here are some examples of things you might ask; however, we encourage you to experiment with any topics related to Android development:

- How do I add camera support to my app?
- I want to create a Room database.
- Can you remind me of the format for Javadocs?
- What is dark theme?
- What's the best way to get location on Android?

Gemini remembers the context of the conversation, so you can also ask it follow-up questions, such as:

- Can you give me the code for this in Kotlin?
- Can you show me how to do it in Compose?

Gemini in Android Studio is uniquely equipped to answers questions about a specific capability or workflow in the Studio IDE, for example:

- How do I analyze UI performance issues in my app?
- Where do I find the CPU profiler?

## Clear conversation history

Gemini remembers your previous chats and is able to use them as context for your conversation. If your chat history is no longer relevant to what you're trying to achieve, reset the chat history by clicking**Clear Conversation History** ![Clear Conversation History icon](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/gemini-reset-chat.png)in the Gemini pane.
