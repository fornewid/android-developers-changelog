# About Gemini in Android Studio

| **Note:** Gemini in Android Studio is only available in the latest stable channel version of Android Studio and major versions released in the previous 10 months. If you are using an older version of Android Studio, you will need to update to use Gemini. For more information, see[Android Studio and Cloud services compatibility](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases#service-compat).

Gemini in Android Studio is your AI-powered coding companion for Android development. It helps you be more productive by answering your development queries, generating code, finding relevant resources, and encouraging best practices. Most importantly, Gemini in Android Studio is uniquely equipped to accelerate Android development---it can help you mock up and troubleshoot Compose UIs, fix Gradle build errors, analyze crashes through integrations with Logcat and App Quality Insights, and more.  

Gemini in Android Studio is available in the following editions:

## What is the right tier for me?

If you're an individual freelance developer, student, or hobbyist we recommend using[Gemini in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/get-started), available at no cost. This includes access to a lightweight version of Gemini 2.5 Pro with a smaller context window, which is appropriate for most tasks. If you need to execute more complex tasks that would benefit from Gemini 2.5 Pro's full 1M token context window, you can[add a Gemini API key](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/add-api-key)and pay per-token.

If you're a professional developer who works as part of a team, ask your administrator to consider subscribing to the[business tier](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/get-started-businesses). Gemini for businesses includes additional features that make it easier to collaborate with your teammates while incorporating your company's best practices and standards, including but not limited to:

- Expanded 1M token context window
