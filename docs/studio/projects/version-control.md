# Version control basics

Android Studio supports a variety of version control systems (VCSs), including Git, GitHub, CVS, Mercurial, Subversion, and Google Cloud Source Repositories.

After importing your app into Android Studio, use the Android Studio VCS menu options to enable VCS support for the desired system, create a repository, import the new files into version control, and perform other version control operations.

To enable VCS support, follow these steps:

1. From the Android Studio**VCS** menu, select**Enable Version Control Integration**.
2. From the menu, select a VCS to associate with the project root.
3. Click**OK**.

The VCS menu now displays a number of version control options based on the system you selected.

**Note:** You can also use the**File \> Settings \> Version Control**menu option to set up and modify the version control settings.
