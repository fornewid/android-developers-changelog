# Generic Compose list optimization

Optimize and measure the performance of a large list.

*** ** * ** ***

    In this Compose file below, I have a LazyColumn or LazyRow displaying a list of items. Optimize its performance for large lists.

    Suggest specific optimizations, like item recycling, using remember, derivedStateOf, or optimizing image loading, and provide code examples to implement these changes.

    Add logging or other performance metrics to measure the improvement.
