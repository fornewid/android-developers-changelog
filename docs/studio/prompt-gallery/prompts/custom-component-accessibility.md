# Custom component accessibility

Make your UI accessible to screen readers.

*** ** * ** ***

    In this Kotlin file, I have a custom UI component (Compose or View).
    Add the necessary code to make it accessible to screen readers.
    Ensure proper use of accessibility events and provide relevant content descriptions or labels.
    Implement state descriptions if the component has different states.
