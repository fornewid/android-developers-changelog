# Network serialization and data classes

Convert data into a data class using serialization.

*** ** * ** ***

    I have a complex data structure representing a nested JSON response from an API.
    Please begin by prompting me for my JSON structure. Then, write a Kotlin data
    class structure to model this response, including handling nullable fields and
    different data types. After, provide a Kotlin function using Gson to deserialize
    a sample JSON string into an instance of this data class.
