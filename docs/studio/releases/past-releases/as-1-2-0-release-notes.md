# Android Studio v1.2.0 (April 2015)


Fixes and enhancements:

<br />

<br />

- Updated the Android runtime window to include the [Memory Monitor](https://developer.android.com/tools/studio#mem-cpu) tool and added a tab for CPU performance monitoring.
- Added a *Captures* tab in the left margin to display the captured memory and CPU performance data files, such as CPU method tracking and memory heap snapshots.
- Expanded [annotation](https://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/annotations) support with additional metadata annotations and inferred nullability.
- Enhanced the Translations Editor with additional support for Best Current Practice (BCP) 47, which uses 3-letter language and region codes.
- Integrated IntelliJ 14 and 14.1 features for improved code analysis and performance:
-
  - Enhanced debugging to show inline values for variables and referring objects, as well as perform inline evaluation of lambda and operator expressions.
  - Added code style detection for tab and indent sizes.
  - Added scratch files for code experiments and prototyping without project files.
  - Added the simultaneous insertion of opening and closing tags in HTML and XML files.
  - Added a built-in Java class decompiler so you can look at what's inside a library for which the source code is not available.
