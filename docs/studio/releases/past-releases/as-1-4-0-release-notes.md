# Android Studio v1.4.0 (September 2015)

Fixes and enhancements:

- Added the [Vector Asset Studio](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/vector-asset-studio) tool for importing vector graphics, such as material icons and SVG files. To use this tool, in the Android view of the Project window, right-click the **res** folder and select **New** \> **Vector Asset**.
- Added new Android Monitor functions, GPU and Network. To use these monitors, click **Android Monitor** at the bottom of the main window. The Android Device Monitor can't be running at the same time as Android Monitor.
- Added an early preview of the new Theme Editor. To use this feature, select **Tools** \> **Android** \> **Theme Editor**.
- Updated the Android templates for the Design Support Library. Templates now include support for the Material Design specification, as well as the `appcompat` Support Library for backwards compatibility.
