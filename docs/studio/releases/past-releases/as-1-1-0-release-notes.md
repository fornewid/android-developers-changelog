# Android Studio v1.1.0 (February 2015)

Various fixes and enhancements:

- Added support for the [Android Wear](https://developer.android.com/design/wear) watch template.
- Modified new project and module creation to include [`res/mipmap`](https://developer.android.com/tools/projects#mipmap) folders for density-specific launcher icons.

- Updated launcher icons to have a [Material Design](https://developer.android.com/design/material) look and added an `xxxhdpi` launcher icon.
- Added and enhanced Lint checks for region and language combinations, launcher icons, resource names, and other common code problems.
- Added support for Best Current Practice (BCP) language tag 47.
