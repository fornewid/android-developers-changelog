# Android Studio v1.0.1 (December 2014)

Various fixes and enhancements:

- Fixed AVD Manager and **device.xml** file lock issue.
- Fixed the emulator log on Windows systems.
- Fixed issue with creating AVDs with Android Studio and Android SDK installed on different drives on Windows systems.
- Sets the default update channel for new downloads to **Stable** . If you installed the 1.0.0 version of Android Studio and would like stable, production-ready version updates, use **File \> Settings \> Updates** to change to the **Stable** update channel.
