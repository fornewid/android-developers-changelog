# Start the emulator from the command line

The Android SDK includes an Android device emulator---a virtual device that runs on your computer. The Android Emulator lets you develop and test Android apps without using a physical device.

This page describes command-line features that you can use with the Android Emulator. For information about using the Android Emulator UI, see[Run apps on the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).

## Start the emulator

Use the`emulator`command to start the emulator, as an alternative to[running your project](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningapp)or[starting it through the AVD Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningemulator).

Here's the basic command-line syntax for starting a virtual device from a terminal prompt:  

```
emulator -avd avd_name [ {-option [value]} … ]
```

Or  

```
emulator @avd_name [ {-option [value]} … ]
```

For example, if you launch the emulator from within Android Studio running on a Mac, the default command line will be similar to the following:  

```
/Users/janedoe/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -avd Pixel8_API_34 -netdelay none -netspeed full -qt-hide-window -grpc-use-token -idle-grpc-timeout
```

Please note that the arguments` -qt-hide-window -grpc-use-token -idle-grpc-timeout `are only used to run the emulator window within Android Studio. If you want to run the emulator on its own window, you should not use those extra parameters.

You can specify startup options when you start the emulator, but not after it has started.

For a list of AVD names, enter the following command:  

```
emulator -list-avds
```

Use this option to display a list of AVD names from your Android home directory. You can override the default home directory by setting the`ANDROID_SDK_HOME`environment variable that specifies the root of the user-specific directory where all configuration and AVD content is stored.

You can set the environment variable in the terminal window before launching a virtual device or through your user settings in the operating system. For example, in your`.bashrc`file on Linux.

To stop the Android Emulator, close the emulator window.

## Install an app

In addition to installing an app through Android Studio or the[emulator UI](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#tasks), you can install your app on a virtual device by using the[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb#move)utility.

To use`adb`to install, run, and test your app, follow these general steps:

1. Build and package your app into an APK, as described in[Build and run your app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run).
2. Start the emulator from the command line, as described in the previous section, using any startup options necessary.
3. Install your app using[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb#move).
4. Run and test your app on the emulator.  
   While the emulator is running, you can use the[Emulator console](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-console)to issue commands as needed.

To uninstall an app, do so as you would on an Android device.

The virtual device preserves the app and its state data across restarts in a user data disk partition (`userdata-qemu.img`). To clear this data, start the emulator with the`-wipe-data`option or wipe the data in the AVD Manager. For more information about the user data partition and other storage, see the following section.

<br />

**Note:** The`adb`utility views the virtual device as an actual physical device. For this reason, you might have to use the`-d`flag with some common`adb`commands, such as`install`. The`-d`flag lets you specify which of several connected devices to use as the target of a command. If you don't specify`-d`, the emulator targets the first device in its list.

## Understand the default directories and files

The emulator uses associated files, of which the AVD system and data directories are the most important. It's helpful to understand the emulator directory structure and files when specifying command-line options, although you typically don't need to modify the default directories or files.

The Android Emulator uses the ([QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/)) hypervisor.

### AVD system directory

The system directory contains the Android system images that the emulator uses to simulate the operating system. This directory has platform-specific, read-only files shared by all AVDs of the same type, including API level, CPU architecture, and Android variant. The default locations are the following:

- macOS and Linux -`~/Library/Android/sdk/system-images/android-`<var translate="no">apiLevel</var>`/`<var translate="no">variant</var>`/`<var translate="no">arch</var>`/`
- Windows -`C:\Users\`<var translate="no">user</var>`\Library\Android\sdk\system-images\android-`<var translate="no">apiLevel</var>`\`<var translate="no">variant</var>`\`<var translate="no">arch</var>`\`

Where:

- <var translate="no">apiLevel</var>is a numeric API level or a letter for preview releases. For example,`android-V`indicates the Android VanillaIceCream preview. On release, it became API level 35, designated by`android-35`.
- <var translate="no">variant</var>is a name corresponding to specific features implemented by the system image. For example,`google_apis`or`android-wear`.
- <var translate="no">arch</var>is the target CPU architecture. For example,`x86`.

Use the`-sysdir`option to specify a different system directory for the AVD.

The emulator reads the following files from the system directory:

**Table 1.**System directory files read by the Android Emulator

|              File              |                                                                                                                                                     Description                                                                                                                                                     | Option to specify a different file |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `kernel-qemu`or`kernel-ranchu` | The binary kernel image for the AVD.`kernel-ranchu`is based on the QEMU emulator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `-kernel`                          |
| `ramdisk.img`                  | The boot partition image. This is a subset of`system.img`loaded by the kernel initially before the system image is mounted. It typically contains just a few binaries and initialization scripts.                                                                                                                   | `-ramdisk`                         |
| `system.img`                   | The read-only, initial version of the system image. Specifically, the partition containing the system libraries and data corresponding to the API level and variant.                                                                                                                                                | `-system`                          |
| `userdata.img`                 | The initial version of the data partition, which appears as`data/`in the emulated system and contains all writable data for the AVD. The emulator uses this file when you create a new AVD or use the`‑wipe-data`option. For more information, see the`userdata-qemu.img`file description in the following section. | `-initdata` `-init-data`           |

### AVD data directory

The AVD data directory, also called the content directory, is specific to a single AVD instance and contains all modifiable data for the AVD.

The default location is the following, where<var translate="no">name</var>is the AVD name:

- macOS and Linux -`~/.android/avd/`<var translate="no">name</var>`.avd/`
- Windows 10, and higher -`C:\Users\`<var translate="no">user</var>`\.android\`<var translate="no">name</var>`.avd\`

Use the`-datadir`option to specify a different AVD data directory.

The following table lists the most important files contained in this directory:

**Table 2.**Important files in the AVD data directory

|        File         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Option to specify a different file |

| `userdata-qemu.img` | The content of the data partition, which appears as`data/`in the emulated system. When you create a new AVD or when you use the`-wipe-data`option to reset the AVD to the factory defaults, the emulator copies the`userdata.img`file in the system directory to create this file. Each virtual device instance uses a writable user-data image to store user and session-specific data. For example, it uses the image to store a unique user's installed app data, settings, databases, and files. Each user has a different`ANDROID_SDK_HOME`directory that stores the data directories for the AVDs created by that user. Each AVD has a single`userdata-qemu.img`file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `-data`                            |
| `cache.img`         | The cache partition image, which appears as`cache/`in the emulated system. It's empty when you first create an AVD or use the`-wipe-data`option. It stores temporary download files and is populated by the download manager and sometimes the system. For example, the browser uses it to cache downloaded web pages and images while the emulator is running. When you power off the virtual device, the file is deleted. You can persist the file by using the`-cache`option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `-cache`                           |
| `sdcard.img`        | (Optional) An SD card partition image that lets you simulate an SD card on a virtual device. You can create an SD card image file in the[AVD Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)or using the[mksdcard](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/mksdcard)tool. The file is stored on your development computer and must be loaded at startup. When defining an AVD in the AVD Manager, you can choose to use an automatically managed SD card file or a file that you created with the`mksdcard`tool. You can view the`sdcard.img`file associated with an AVD in the AVD Manager. The`-sdcard`option overrides the SD card file specified in the AVD. Note that this SD Card option will not work on Mac with Apple Silicon. You can browse, send files to, and copy and remove files from a simulated SD card by using the emulator UI or the[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#copyfiles)utility while the virtual device is running. You can't remove a simulated SD card from a running virtual device. To copy files to the SD card file before loading it, mount the image file as a loop device and then copy the files. Or, use a utility, such as the`mtools`package, to copy the files directly to the image. The emulator treats the file as a pool of bytes, so the SD card format doesn't matter. The`-wipe-data`option doesn't affect this file. If you want to clear the file, delete the file and then re-create it using the AVD Manager or the`mksdcard`tool. Changing the size of the file also deletes the file and creates a new file. | `-sdcard`                          |

<br />

### List directories and files used by the emulator

You can discover where files are located in two ways:

- Use the`-verbose`or`-debug init`option when you start the emulator from the command line. Look at the output.
- Use the`emulator``-help-`<var translate="no">option</var>command to list a default directory. For example:  

  ```
  emulator -help-datadir

    Use '-datadir <dir>' to specify a directory where writable image files
    will be searched. On this system, the default directory is:

        /Users/me/.android

    See '-help-disk-images' for more information about disk image files.
  ```

## Command-line startup options

This section lists options you can supply on the command line when you start the emulator.

<br />

**Note:** The Android Emulator is continually under development to make it more reliable. For status on the issues reported against various command-line options and to report bugs, see the[Android Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues?q=componentid:192708&s=modified_time:descfirst).

### Commonly used options

For example: ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -webcam-list List of web cameras connected to the computer: Camera 'webcam0' is connected to device 'webcam0' on channel 0 using pixel format 'UYVY' ``` In the example, the first`webcam0`is the name you use on the command line. The second`webcam0`is the name used by the OS on the development computer. The second name varies depending on the OS. As of SDK Tools 25.2.4, the AVD name is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Separate multiple tags by a space, comma, or column. For example: <br /> ``` $ emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -debug init,metrics ``` To disable a tag, place a dash (-) in front of it. For example, the following option displays all debug messages, except the ones related to network sockets and metrics: `-debug all,-socket,-metrics` For a list of tags and descriptions, use the`-help-debug-tags`option. For example: <br /> ``` emulator -help-debug-tags ``` You can define the default debug tags in the[`ANDROID_VERBOSE`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables#android_verbose)environment variable.

It's a list of space- or comma-separated log filters of the format<var translate="no">componentName</var>`:`<var translate="no">logLevel</var>.<var translate="no">componentName</var>is either a wildcard asterisk (`*`) or a component name, such as`ActivityManager`,`SystemServer`,`InputManager`, or`WindowManager`. <var translate="no">logLevel</var>is one of these values: - `v`- verbose - `d`- debug - `i`- informative - `w`- warning log level - `e`- error - `s`- silent The following example displays GSM component messages at the informative log level: <br /> ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -logcat '*:s GSM:i' ``` If you don't supply the`-logcat`option on the command line, the emulator looks for the[`ANDROID_LOG_TAGS`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables#android_log_tags)environment variable. If`ANDROID_LOG_TAGS`is defined with a valid<var translate="no">logtags</var>value and isn't empty, the emulator uses its value to enable Logcat output to the terminal by default. You can also redirect the same or other log messages to the terminal through`adb`.

For example: <br /> ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -port 5556 ``` The default value is 5554 for the first virtual device instance running on the your machine. A virtual device normally occupies a pair of adjacent ports: a console port and an`adb`port. The console of the first virtual device running on a particular machine uses console port 5554 and`adb`port 5555. Subsequent instances use port numbers increasing by two. For example, 5556/5557, 5558/5559, and so on. The range is 5554 to 5682, allowing for 64 concurrent virtual devices. The port assignments are often the same as specifying`-ports `<var translate="no">port</var>`,{`<var translate="no">port</var>` + 1}`.`{`<var translate="no">port</var>` + 1}`must be free and is reserved for`adb`. If any of the console or`adb`ports are already in use, the emulator won't start. The`‑port`option reports which ports and serial number the virtual device is using and warns if there are any issues with the values you provided. In the emulator UI, you can see the console port number in the window title and view the`adb`port number by selecting**Help** \>**About**. Note that if the<var translate="no">port</var>value is not even and is in the range 5554 to 5584, the virtual device will start but not be visible when you use the`adb devices`command, if the`adb server`starts after the emulator. For this reason, we recommend using an even console port number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `-ports ` <var translate="no">console-port</var>`,`<var translate="no">adb-port</var>        | Sets the TCP ports used for the console and`adb`. For example: <br /> ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -ports 5556,5559 ``` The valid ports range is 5554 to 5682, allowing for 64 concurrent virtual devices. The`-ports`option reports which ports and serial number the emulator instance is using and warns if there are any issues with the values you provided. We recommend using the`-port`option instead, where possible. The`-ports`option is available for network configurations that require special settings. For more information about setting console and`adb`ports, see the`-port`option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note that this option captures all ethernet packets and isn't limited to TCP connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

For example: <br /> ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -accel auto ``` Accelerated emulation works for x86 and x86_64 system images only. On Linux, it relies on KVM. On Windows and Mac, it relies on an Intel CPU and Intel HAXM driver. This option is ignored if you're not emulating an x86 or x86_64 device. Valid values for<var translate="no">mode</var>are: - `auto`- Determines automatically if acceleration is supported and uses it when possible (default). - `off`- Disables acceleration entirely, which is primarily useful for debugging. - `on`- Forces acceleration. If KVM or HAXM isn't installed or usable, the emulator won't start and prints an error message.

This option only logs policy violations.`disabled`mode disables kernel support for SELinux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Advanced options

The command-line startup options in the following table are available but not commonly used by the average app developer.

In the descriptions, the*working directory* is the current directory in the terminal where you're entering commands. For information about the AVD system directory and data directory and the files stored within them, see the section about[default directories and files](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline#filedir).

Some of these options are appropriate for external app developers, and some of them are used primarily by platform developers.*App developers* create Android apps and run them on specific AVDs.*Platform developers*work on the Android system and run it inside the emulator with no pre-created AVD.

| `-bootchart `<var translate="no">timeout</var>                                                 | Enables bootcharting with a timeout in seconds. Some Android system images have a modified init system that integrates a bootcharting facility. You can pass a bootcharting timeout period to the system with this option. If your init system doesn't have bootcharting activated, the option does nothing. This option is primarily useful to platform developers, not external app developers.

| `-initdata `<var translate="no">filepath</var> `-init-data `<var translate="no">filepath</var> | Specifies the initial version of the data partition. After wiping user data, the emulator copies the contents of the specified file to user data (by default, the`userdata-qemu.img`file) instead of using the default`userdata.img`file as the initial version.

For example: ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -shell ```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Rather than executing a full boot sequence, the emulator can resume execution from an earlier state snapshot, which is usually significantly faster. When you supply this option, the emulator loads the snapshot of that name from the snapshot image and saves it back under the same name on exit. If you don't use this option, the default is a full boot sequence. If the specified snapshot doesn't exist, the emulator performs a full boot sequence instead and performs a save operation. See the`-snapstorage`option for information on specifying a snapshot storage file and the default file. ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -snapshot snapshot2 ``` Remember that in the process of loading a snapshot, all contents of the system, user data, and SD card images are overwritten with the contents they held when the snapshot was made. Unless you save this information in a different snapshot, any changes since then are lost. You can also create a snapshot from the emulator console by using the`avd snapshot save `<var translate="no">name</var>command.

This command prints a table of snapshots that are stored in the snapshot storage file that the emulator was started with, then exits. If you specify`-snapstorage `<var translate="no">file</var>as well, this command prints a table of the snapshots stored in file. For example: ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -snapshot-list -snapstorage ~/.android/avd/Pixel8_API_34.avd/snapshots-test.img ``` You can use the ID and TAG column values in the output as arguments for the`-snapshot`option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

All snapshots made during execution are saved in this file. Only snapshots in this file can be restored during the emulator run. For example: ``` emulator @Pixel8_API_34 -snapstorage ~/.android/avd/Pixel8_API_34.avd/snapshots-test.img ``` If you don't specify this option, the default is`snapshots.img`in the data directory. If the specified file doesn't exist, the emulator will start, but without support for saving or loading state snapshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Get help about command-line options

This section describes how to get help about the command-line options. It provides more in-depth information about the commonly used emulator command-line options that are available when you start the emulator.

### List all emulator options

To print a list of all emulator options, including a short description, enter the following command:  

```
emulator -help
```

### Get detailed help for a specific option

To print help for a specific startup option, enter the following command:  

```
emulator -help-option
```

For example:  

```
emulator -help-netspeed
```

This help is more detailed than the description provided by the`-help`option.

### Get detailed help for all options

To get detailed help for all emulator options, enter the following command:  

```
emulator -help-all
```

### List emulator environment variables

To get a list of emulator environment variables, enter the following command:  

```
emulator -help-environment
```

You can set environment variables in the terminal window before launching a virtual device, or you can set it through your user settings in the operating system. For example, set it in your`.bashrc`file on Linux.

### List debug tags

To print a list of tags for the`-debug`options, enter the following command:  

```
emulator -help-debug-tags
```

The`-debug`options let you enable or disable debug messages from specific emulator components, as specified by the tags.
