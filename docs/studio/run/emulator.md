# Run apps on the Android Emulator

The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer so that you can test your application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device. The emulator offers these advantages:

- **Flexibility**: In addition to being able to simulate a variety of devices and Android API levels, the emulator comes with predefined configurations for various Android phone, tablet, Wear OS, Android Automotive OS, and Android TV devices.

- **High fidelity**: The emulator provides almost all the capabilities of a real Android device. You can simulate incoming phone calls and text messages, specify the location of the device, simulate different network speeds, simulate rotation and other hardware sensors, access the Google Play Store, and much more.

- **Speed**: Testing your app on the emulator is in some ways faster and easier than doing so on a physical device. For example, you can transfer data faster to the emulator than to a device connected over USB.

In most cases, the emulator is the best option for your testing needs. This page covers the core emulator functionalities and how to get started with it.

Alternatively, you can deploy your app to a physical device. For more information, see[Run apps on a hardware device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

## Get started with the emulator

The Android Emulator lets you test your app on many different devices virtually. The emulator comes with Android Studio, so you don't need to install it separately. To use the emulator, follow these basic steps, which are described in more detail in the sections that follow:

1. [Verify that you have the system requirements](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#requirements).
2. [Create an Android Virtual Device (AVD)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#avd).
3. [Run your app on the emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningapp).
4. [Navigate the emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#navigate).

This page covers the steps to set up and explore your virtual testing environment in more detail. If you already have your app running on the emulator and are ready to use more advanced features, see[Advanced emulator usage](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/advanced-emulator-usage).

If you're experiencing issues with the emulator, see[Troubleshoot known issues with Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-troubleshooting). Depending on your needs and resources, it might be worth delving into system requirements and technical configurations, or it might be better to use a physical device.

### Emulator system requirements

For the best experience, you should use the emulator in Android Studio on a computer with at least the following specs:

- 16 GB RAM
- 64-bit Windows 10 or higher, MacOS 12 or higher, Linux, or ChromeOS operating system
- 16 GB disk space

| **Note:** If you're using a ChromeOS operating system, check the[devices that support the Android Emulator](https://chromeos.dev/en/android-environment#android-emulator-support)in the ChromeOS documentation.

Running higher API levels and/or virtual devices with larger screens may require higher system specs than listed above. If you don't have these specs, the emulator might still run but not smoothly. In this case, consider testing on a physical device instead by following the guidance at[Run apps on a hardware device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).

### Create an Android Virtual Device

Each instance of the Android Emulator uses an*Android virtual device (AVD)* to specify the Android version and hardware characteristics of the simulated device. To create an AVD, see[Create and manage virtual devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).

Each AVD functions as an independent device with its own private storage for user data, SD card, and so on. By default, the emulator stores the user data, SD card data, and cache in a directory specific to that AVD. When you launch the emulator, it loads the user data and SD card data from the AVD directory.

### Run your app on the emulator

After you have created an AVD, you can start the Android Emulator and run an app in your project:

1. In the toolbar, select the AVD that you want to run your app on from the target device menu.

   ![The target device menu](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/run/target-device-dropdown.png)**Figure 1.**The target device menu.
2. Click**Run** . The emulator might take a minute or so to launch for the first time, but subsequent launches use a[snapshot](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/advanced-emulator-usage#snapshots)and should launch faster. If you experience issues, see the[troubleshooting guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-troubleshooting).

Once your app is installed on your AVD, you can run it from the device as you would run any app on a device. Any time you want to deploy new changes, you need to click**Run** or**Apply Changes**again.

#### Wear OS pairing assistant

If you want to test your app with Wear OS devices, the Wear OS pairing assistant guides you step-by-step through pairing Wear OS emulators with physical or virtual phones directly in Android Studio. To learn more, see[Use the Wear OS emulator pairing assistant](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/get-started/creating#pairing-assistant).

### Navigate the emulator

While the emulator is running, you can use your computer mouse pointer to mimic your finger on the touch screen and use the emulator panel to perform common actions.

#### Navigate the emulator screen

Use your computer mouse pointer to mimic your finger on the touchscreen, select menu items and input fields, and click buttons and controls. Use your computer keyboard to type characters and enter emulator shortcuts.

#### Perform common actions using the emulator panel

To perform common actions with the emulator, use the emulator toolbar, if you're running the emulator within Android Studio, or the panel on the right side, if you're running the emulator in a window outside of Android Studio. Table 2 describes common emulator actions and associated buttons.

You can use keyboard shortcuts to perform many common actions in the emulator. For a complete list of shortcuts in the emulator, press<kbd>F1</kbd>(<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>on macOS) to open the Help pane in the[Extended controls](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/advanced-emulator-usage#extended)window.
