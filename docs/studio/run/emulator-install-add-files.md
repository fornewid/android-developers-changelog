# Install and add files

If you want to use an app that's not available in the Google Play Store on the Android Emulator, or if you want to install a specific APK, you can manually install the APK file by using a drag-and-drop.

To install an APK file on the emulated device, drag an APK file onto the emulator screen. An APK Installer dialog appears. When the installation completes, you can view the app in your apps list.

To add a file to the emulated device, drag the file onto the emulator screen. The file is placed in the`/sdcard/Download/`directory. You can view the file from Android Studio using the[Device Explorer](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/device-file-explorer)or find it from the device using the**Downloads** or**Files**app, depending on the device version.
