# Wi-Fi

When using an AVD with API level 25 or higher, the emulator provides a simulated
Wi-Fi access point ("AndroidWifi"), and Android automatically connects to it.

You can disable Wi-Fi in the emulator by running the emulator with the
[command-line parameter](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline)
`-feature -Wifi`.
