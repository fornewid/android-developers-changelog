# Launch the emulator without launching an app

Sometimes you might want to launch the emulator without running an app, such as if you want to see how two emulator devices interact with each other when paired over Bluetooth. To launch the emulator without launching an app, follow these steps:

1. [Open the Device Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
2. Double-click an AVD or select an AVD and click**Run** ![](https://developer.android.com/static/studio/images/buttons/toolbar-run.png). The Android Emulator loads.

While the emulator is running, you can run Android Studio projects and choose the emulator as the target device. You can also install one or more APKs onto the emulator, as described in the following section, and then run them.
