[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)is a mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. Firebase consists of complementary features that you can mix and match to fit your needs, with[Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/)at the core. You can explore and integrate Firebase services in your app directly from Android Studio using the**Assistant**window shown in figure 1.

First, make sure you have[added Google's Maven repository](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies#google-maven)to your project configuration.

You can open and use the**Assistant**window in Android Studio by following these steps:

1. Select**Tools \> Firebase** to open the**Assistant**window.
2. Click to expand one of the listed features.
3. Click**Get Started with Firebase Analytics**to open a tutorial that connects you to Firebase and adds the necessary code to your app.

For more information about using Firebase services, see the[Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/).
