Develop

### [Playback](http://developer.android.com/media/implement/playback-app)

Use ExoPlayer, the default Player implementation in Media3, or build your own player by implementing the SimpleBasePlayer class. Then extend your playback capabilities by implementing a MediaSession or MediaLibraryService.
