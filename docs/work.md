# Android for enterprise

![Mobile and tablet devices displaying Android apps compatible with Android in the enterprise](https://developer.android.com/static/images/work/hero_650px.png)

Android provides organizations with a secure and flexible mobility platform---combining devices,
apps, and management.

All Android apps are compatible with the platform's enterprise features, but there are additional
features you can use to make your app work best on managed Android devices:

- **Work profile best practice**: modify your Android app so it functions best on a managed device.
- **Managed configurations**: modify your app to allow IT admins the option to specify custom settings for your apps.
- **Dedicated devices**: optimize your app so that it can be deployed on an Android device as a kiosk.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: simplify the sign-on process for users signing in to different apps on their managed Android device.


**Note:** For tips on how to manage devices and applications across an enterprise,
