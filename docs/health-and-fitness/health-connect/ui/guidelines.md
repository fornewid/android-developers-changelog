Your app's user interface (UI) should focus on articulating the benefits of
using Health Connect, and explain key concepts in a way that enhances user
knowledge of what an integration entails.

Your user experience (UX) should adhere to three guiding principles:

1. **Consistency**: Verify that flows are aligned throughout the integration process.
2. **Transparency**: Be up front in explaining how Health Connect works alongside your app.
3. **Clarity**: Help users access Health Connect through your app.

At a high-level, the UX flow can be broken down into the following stages:

## Assets

Product icons should be used on a white or a very light gray background.
You may also use the icon on a black background if necessary.
| **Note:** All product icons should have a transparent background when placed on a solid background.
