Your app's Settings screen should provide users with options to manage their
connection to Health Connect. This gives users control over data
synchronization and access to their data.

## Sync with Health Connect

This toggle provides a way for users to pause or resume data
synchronization between your app and Health Connect.

- **When toggled on:** Your app actively reads and writes to Health Connect, as per the permissions granted by the user.
- **When toggled off:** Your app should stop all data synchronization with Health Connect. If you programmatically revoke permissions using [`revokeAllPermissions()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/health/connect/client/PermissionController#revokeAllPermissions()), explain to the user that the changes aren't immediately reflected in Health Connect without an app restart. To avoid a confusing user experience, give users the option to go to Health Connect settings to revoke permissions there.

## Manage access

The **Manage access** button should provide a direct link for the user to manage
your app's permissions from within the Health Connect app. This gives the user
full control and transparency.

## Insufficient access

If your app has insufficient Health Connect access, users should be presented
with the following screen across all entry points:

## Permissions cancelled twice

If the user selects **Cancel** on the permissions request screen twice in a
row, your app should present the user with a screen similar to the following:
