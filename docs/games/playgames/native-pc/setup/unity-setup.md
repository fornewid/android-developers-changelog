If you are developing games using the Unity Game Engine, you will benefit a lot
from using the `PlayPcSdkManaged.unitypackage` to install the SDK immediately to
your Unity project rather than developing the C# to C++ glue code yourself.

Download the [Play Games PC Unity SDK](https://developer.android.com/games/playgames/native-pc/setup/<a href=)"\>tgz artifact and follow the instructions
in [Add PC SDK to a game](https://developer.android.com/games/playgames/native-pc/setup), paying close attention to the
differences between C++ and C# code snippets
