With the Publishing API, you can automate frequent tasks having to do
with games production and distribution. This API provides functions similar to
those available through the
[Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/),
such as:

- Creating and editing [achievement](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/achievements) listings.
- Creating and editing [leaderboard](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/leaderboards) listings.
- Uploading icon images for achievements and leaderboards.

**Note:** You can use the Publishing API along with the
[Google Play Developer API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/).

You can access the REST APIs directly via HTTP. For more information, see
[Publishing API reference](https://developers.google.com/games/services/publishing/api)
and the
[sample app](https://github.com/playgameservices/management-tools).
