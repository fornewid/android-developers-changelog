By using this API, you consent to be bound by these terms in addition to the [Google APIs Terms of Service](http://developers.google.com/terms) ("API ToS").

1.

   ## Developer Content Policies

   To use Google Play Games Services, you must comply with the
   [Google Play Developer Policies](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none).
2.

   ## Gameplay Information

   You must not permit your API Client to: (1) submit to Google any false gameplay
   information (such as invalid scores for a user in a leaderboard, or an achievement that
   a user did not earn); (2) send or accept an invite to, or take a turn in, a multiplayer
   game (including automatching requests) without an explicit approval from a user; or (3)
   send, request, or accept an in-game gift, without an explicit approval from a user.
3.

   ## Privacy and Data Protection

   Google Play Games Services makes certain user data available to you solely to provide
   and improve your games. By using Google Play Games Services, you agree to the
   [Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprcontrollerterms/). In addition, you must not use
   data from Google Play Games Services for advertising purposes.

   If you use the Google Play Games Services to access an end user's friend data, you may
   not store or retain an end user's friends data received from your use of the APIs
   (including any derived data) for more than 30 calendar days. After 30 calendar days, you
   must either delete or refresh the stored data via a new call to the APIs. You may use an
   end user's friends data that you received from your use of the APIs (including any
   derived data) only for the purpose of displaying a friends list to the end user within
   the game or enabling related friends functionality visible to the end user and not for
   any other purpose (including improving your apps or services, research, advertising, or
   marketing purposes). Additionally, you may not sell, license, share, or otherwise make
   available to third parties friends data that you received from your use of the APIs
   (including any derived data) except as necessary to comply with applicable law.

   For API Clients that use their own avatar/naming system in place of Play Games Services
   identity then you must make clear to users that their gameplay information will still be
   submitted to Google and associated with their Play Games identity and viewable within
   different Google products.

   You must not permit your API Client to reveal the user's Google identity to other
   users in multiplayer matches where players are automatically matched using Google Play
   Games Services.
4.

   ## Submission of Content

   The "Submission of Content" provision in Section 5 of the API ToS is deleted in its
   entirety and replaced with the following:


   "Some of our APIs allow the submission of content, and except as expressly provided in
   these Terms, Google does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights
   in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client. By submitting,
   posting or displaying content to or from the APIs through your API Client, you give
   Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to
   use, host, store, reproduce, adapt, modify, create derivative works, communicate,
   translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content only
   for the purpose of enabling Google to provide and improve the APIs and our services and
   to develop new ones, in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policies. You
   agree that this license includes a right for Google to make such content available to
   other companies, organizations or individuals (including the end user): (a) with whom
   Google has relationships for the provision of syndicated services, and to use such
   content in connection with the provision of those services; or (b) where the applicable
   end user of your API Client directs Google to make such content available. Before you
   submit content to our APIs through your API Client, ensure that you have the necessary
   rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license."

   Nothing in this Section 5 is intended to grant Google a license to make the API
   Client available on our properties following your notice of termination as set forth
   in Section 8 of the API ToS.
5.

   ## Indemnification

   The "Indemnification" provision in Section 9 of the API ToS is deleted in its entirety
   and replaced with the following:

   "You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Google and its subsidiaries, affiliates,
   officers, agents, employees, and partners from and against any third party claim
   arising from or in any way related to:
   - your misuse of Google Play Games Services
   - your violation of these Terms; or
   - any third party's misuse of Google Play Games Services or actions that would constitute a violation of these terms provided that you enabled such third party to access the APIs or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent such third party from accessing the APIs, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Google will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit, or action."
6.

   ## Object Code License

   Any Google-provided object code that calls the APIs is part of the APIs. Subject to these
   terms, you may copy and distribute this code solely for inclusion as part of your API
   Client. Google and its licensors own all right, title and interest, including all
   intellectual property and other proprietary rights, in and to this code. You will not
   modify, translate, or create derivative works of the code.
