In May 2021, Google Play
[announced the new Data safety section](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html),
which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing,
and security practices.

This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in
regards to your usage of the Play Games Services Android and/or C++ SDKs. On
this page, you can find information on whether and how our SDKs handle end-user
data, including examples of applicable configurations or invocations you can
control as the app developer.

We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you. However, as the app
developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google
Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection,
sharing, and security practices.

## How to use the information on this page

This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version of the
[Play Games Services SDKs](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/downloads).

We provide information about data collected automatically and data collected
depending on your usage. Automatic collection means that the SDK collects
specific data without you invoking any specific method or class in your app.
However, in many cases, the data collected by the SDK depends on your app's
specific usage of the product, meaning your app's configuration and how you
invoke the SDK.

To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's
[guide about data types](https://developers.android.com/guide/topics/data/collect-share) to help you determine
which data type best describes the collected data. In your data disclosure, make
sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected
data.

## Overview of data encryption, data sharing, and data deletion for Play Games Services SDKs

|---|---|
| **Data encryption** | For the collected end-user data listed on this page, Play Games Services encrypts the data in transit using HTTPS. |
| **Data sharing** | Game Services data is exposed using a 3rd-party API. Your Play Games Services enabled game can only read/write the authenticated player's data for that game. It cannot access games service data for another game a user plays. When a user logs into your game using Play Games Services, their gamer identity is shared with your Play Games Services enabled game. Users choose whether their profile is for "Friends only," for "Everyone," or "Only you." When users choose the "Friends only" visibility, only users added as friends can see game data for the profile. If public, all other users can see game data for the profile. If private, other users can only see that the display name is in use, but not any game/gameplay data. Users can also choose whether Play Games Services enabled games can access their friends lists (includes only the display name, not the email address) automatically or only when prompted by a game. |
| **Data deletion** | Users can delete their account and all associated games data collected by Google through their [Play Games profile](https://play.google.com/games/profile) or [Google MyAccount](https://myaccount.google.com). If Google collects Play Games Services data for an individual game, users can delete the data through their [Play Games profile](https://play.google.com/games/profile). |

## Play Games Services SDKs

### Data collected automatically

The Play Games Services SDKs collect the following data automatically.

| Data | Default behavior |
|---|---|
| Game Service | Collects the following Games account data when a user creates and updates their games account: - Gamer Identity (Gamertag, avatar) |
| Analytics | Collects analytics data to improve the stability of our SDKs and make product improvements. |
| Diagnostics | Collects diagnostics data to improve the stability of our SDKs and make product improvements. |

### Data collected depending on your usage

Depending on how you configure or invoke the Play Games Services SDKs and the
product's features, your app may collect end-user data that needs to be included
in your data disclosure. The following table lists examples of end-user data
that can be collected depending on your usage, but make sure to account for any
data collected by your specific usage.

| Data | Details |
|---|---|
| Game Service | Cumulative data generated by users during gameplay and stored on Google's servers for game analytics. The player data to collect is defined by your app. This might include metrics such as how often users do the following (examples only): - Use a particular item - Reach a certain level - Perform a specific game action |
| Game Service | Service data when a user progresses through a game. For example: - Unlocked achievements - Games scores - Engagement and spend statistics - Social connections (Friend connections, requests, nicknames for friends) |
| Metagame data | Metagame data when a user progresses through a game. For example: - Title - Level - Experience points - Experience points history - Experience points per category |
| Saved Games | Save game data when a user progresses through a game: - Saved game progress - Saved game screenshot |
