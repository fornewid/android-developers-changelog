# Android Game Development Extension overview

For developers building games for multiple platforms with C/C++ code, the Android Game Development Extension allows you to easily add Android as another target platform in your existing Visual C++ project. You can then use Visual Studio on Windows to build and deploy the Android version of your game to physical devices or an emulator.

When using the extension, Visual Studio offers full IntelliSense and debugging support for your native code via LLDB. The extension is also compatible with Incredibuild so you can continue to use your existing infrastructure and keep your build times as fast as possible.
