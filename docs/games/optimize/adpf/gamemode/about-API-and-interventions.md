# Game Mode

The[Game Mode API](https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/adpf/gamemode/gamemode-api)and[Game Mode interventions](https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/adpf/gamemode/gamemode-interventions)allow you to optimize gameplay by prioritizing characteristics, such as performance or battery life based on users settings or game specific configurations.

The Game Mode API and interventions are available starting with[Android 12](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get)on selected devices.  

## Optimize with Game Mode API

You can use the[Game Mode API](https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/adpf/gamemode/gamemode-api)to identify the current game mode that was selected by the user, and then optimize your game for the best performance or battery life based on their selection.

Learn how to set up, optimize, and publish your game to support standard, performance and battery modes.

## Game Mode interventions

[Game Mode interventions](https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/adpf/gamemode/gamemode-interventions)are game specific optimizations set by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to improve the performance of games that are no longer being updated by developers.

Learn how to set up, test and submit interventions for your game with performance and battery modes.
| **Important:** Each game may implement the Game Mode API behavior, propose Game Mode interventions settings to OEMs, or explicitly opt-out of Game Mode interventions.
| **Warning:** OEMs may choose to implement Game Mode interventions without developer feedback.
