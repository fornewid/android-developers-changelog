# Deliver assets

Use the following best practices to help you deliver assets for your Android game.

## Play Asset Delivery

Play Asset Delivery delivers large amounts of game assets via[Android App Bundles](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle)with flexible delivery modes, auto-updates, texture compression, and delta patching.

For more information, see the[Play Asset Delivery Guides](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery).

## Integrate native asset delivery

The Play Core SDK enables your C and C++ game needs to initialize, download, install, and access asset packs from Google Play.
