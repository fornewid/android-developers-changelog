# About Android game development tools

Android tools and libraries support using, creating, or extending game engines and using popular IDEs.

## Create or extend game engines

| **Note:** If you're new to Android game development, the[new game developer guide](https://developer.android.com/games/guides/basics)provides guidance about choosing development tools and libraries, such as a game engine or graphics API.

- [Use a game engine](https://developer.android.com/games/engines/engines-overview): Use a game engine such as Unity, Unreal, Defold or Godot to develop Android games.

- [Create or extend a game engine](https://developer.android.com/games/develop/custom/overview): Create a new game engine or extend an existing game to support Android game development.

## Development tools and libraries

- [Android Game Development Kit (AGDK)](https://developer.android.com/games/agdk/overview): This is our main collection of Android game development and optimization tools and libraries. It supports multiple game engine usage and development scenarios and includes a library for managing Android app events in C/C++ code.

- [Android Game Development Extension (AGDE)](https://developer.android.com/games/agde): This a Visual Studio extension that allows you to build Android games from Visual Studio using your existing projects.

- [Google Play Games for PC](https://developer.android.com/games/playgames/overview): This platform brings your Android game to Windows using high-performance emulation. It allows cross-device play between Android, ChromeOS, and Windows while using the same code base.

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/games/develop/develop-as): Android Studio provides many useful support tasks for Android game development, such as Android project management, dependency integration, debugging, and profiling.

### Add game services

Many[Google Play](https://developer.android.com/games/distribute/overview)features are oriented towards distributing and maintaining your game; however,[Google Play Games Services](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/overview#features)provides social and competitive features you can add while developing your game. These include features such as achievements, saved games, and player sign-in.

### Optimization

We provide many optimization tools and APIs that are designed for Android games and graphic intensive apps. These are often used as you iterate and maintain your game; however, you may want to consider using some of them as you develop a new game. For example, it might be good to start developing your game using APIs such as[Game Mode](https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/adpf/gamemode/about-API-and-interventions)and[Memory Advice](https://developer.android.com/games/sdk/memory-advice/overview). Likewise you might want to start using[Android GPU Inspector](https://developer.android.com/agi)during the initial testing of your game. See the Android games[optimization overview](https://developer.android.com/games/optimize/overview)for more information.
