# Sample, Codelab, Developer Stories and Videos

## Samples

### Hello Vulkan

The[Hello Vulkan](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/tree/main/hello-vulkan)sample demonstrates how to set up your Android application to use Vulkan. The end result is just a colored triangle on screen but it shows in detail all the setup process needed.

For in depth understanding of each step, check out the codelab which is based on this sample and expanded to render a textured, rotating triangle instead.

### AGDK Tunnel

The[AGDK Tunnel](https://github.com/android/games-samples/tree/main/agdk/agdktunnel)sample demonstrates a simple endless game supporting both Vulkan and OpenGL ES. It shows how to check the device for Vulkan support and fallback to OpenGL ES if support is inadequate.

### Unity Boat Attack

[Unity Boat Attack](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/BoatAttack)is an open source sample project specifically created to aid the testing and development of Unity's[Universal Render Pipeline](https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline). It is meant for discovery of how some of the URP features work and a learning resource for some tricks.

Check out the open source[repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/BoatAttack)to learn more!

### UE4 Sun Temple

[Sun Temple](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sun-temple)is specifically built sample for Unreal Engine 4.x to demonstrate the power of the engine in the mobile gaming world. Use it to check out what Vulkan can bring to your mobile game!

### UE5 Lyra Starter Game

[Lyra Starter Game](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/lyra)is a new sample gameplay project released with UE5 to demonstrate the latest best practices for making games in UE5. It is intended to be the starting point for game developers to create new projects and to serve as customizable learning resources. Export it with Vulkan on Android to check out the capabilities of Vulkan on Android mobile devices!

### Filament

[Filament](https://github.com/google/filament/tree/main/android/samples)is a real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, Linux, iOS, macOS, Windows and WebGL. It is designed to be as small and efficient as possible.

## Codelab

The[Getting started with Vulkan on Android](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/beginning-vulkan-on-android)codelab guides you through setting up your Vulkan rendering pipeline and then rendering a textured, rotating triangle on the screen. You can then continue to use the project to render your game graphics.

## Developer Stories

Increasingly, game developers around the world are releasing Vulkan only titles. This enables them to focus on their game instead of having to work on supporting legacy technology. Releasing Vulkan only titles enables them to make full use of improvements made available to modern mobile chips.

Check out how these developers use Vulkan for better graphics!

### Vulkanised 2024

Vulkanised is the largest event dedicated to developers using the Vulkan API. It brings the Vulkan developer community together to exchange ideas, solve problems and help steer the future development of the Vulkan API and ecosystem.

The latest edition was hosted on February 5 - 7, 2024 in Google Campus in Sunnyvale. The full agenda with all the presenters' decks can be found in[Vulkanised 2024 Agenda](https://vulkan.org/events/vulkanised-2024#agenda).

Most of the sessions are recorded and the replay can be viewed on[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMLurvdlOpWOh_nXIbXbBewWuERe-8xVW).

### Vulkanised 2023

The 2023 edition of the Vulkanised covers plenty of interesting progress for Vulkan on mobile chips as well. The full agenda with the videos and decks can be found in[Vulkanised 2023 Agenda](https://vulkan.org/events/vulkanised-2023#agenda), and the recorded sessions are on this[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOKIeIr77Ow&list=PLMLurvdlOpWOluO2PqfGO7XBU8FBlpDug).
