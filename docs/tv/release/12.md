We've added more customizations to Android 12 to improve the experience and compatibility on TV devices. Some of the highlights for TV are media playback improvements, more refined user interface capabilities, and privacy and security enhancements. In addition, we're introducing better standards to support and improve HDMI and tuners.

Refer to the[Android 12 documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/summary)for a full list of the changes included in Android 12. Note that not all features apply to TV.

Download the system images for the[ADT-3 Developer Kit](https://store.askey.com/adt-3.html)to get started. Alternatively, you can use the[Android Emulator for TV](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/get-started/create#run-on-a-virtual-device), which lets you try some of the new user interface capabilities like background blurs and 4K UI support.

## How to get started

If you have an existing ADT-3 developer device, the device will automatically receive an OTA to Android 12. Alternatively, you can install Android 12 by following these steps:

1. Use the[ADT-3 Developer Kit](https://store.askey.com/adt-3.html)for Android TV. The provided system image is for ADT-3 developer devices only.
2. Download the system image.
3. Install the system image on your ADT-3 device.

| **Warning:** Once you successfully flash the ADT-3 to Android 12, you can't go back to the previous Android 11 build without wiping the user data.

## Install system images manually

You can download the latest Android 12 system image and manually flash it to your test device. Manually flashing a device gives you precise control over the test environment and can be performed with command line tools.

After you back up your device data, download one of the following ADT-3 builds and then[flash the image onto your device](https://developers.google.com/android/images).
