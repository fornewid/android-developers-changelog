### Get started with large screens

Large screens expand your app development opportunities. The large screens of tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS devices showcase content, facilitate multitasking, and enable user interfaces not possible on small screens.

## Imagine your app on large screens

A more productive productivity app, more engaging media app, more immersive game. Imagine what you can do with the wide open display space of large screens.

## Build for everyone...

Large screen devices are a fast growing market segment. Enable your app to run on all large screen form factors in addition to standard phones. Make your app available to as many users as possible. Build for every device, for everyone.

## ...with the help of app quality guidelines

[![Depiction of the three tiers of the adaptive app quality guidelines.](http://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/quality_guidelines_header_small.png)](http://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality)  
To get started with large screen development, follow the *Adaptive app quality guidelines*. The guidelines are a comprehensive set of requirements designed to help make your app the best it can be on all display sizes, including large screens.  
[Quality guidelines](http://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality)

### App quality tiers

The quality guidelines are organized into three tiers: *Adaptive ready* , *Adaptive optimized* , and *Adaptive differentiated* . Add large screen capabilities to your app by progressively working through the tiers, starting with *Adaptive ready* . If you have an existing app, use the [quality guideline tests](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_app_compatibility_tests) to determine the tier your app supports, then implement features tier by tier until your app is uniquely differentiated for large screens. [![Depiction of Tier 3 of the Adaptive app quality guidelines.](http://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/tier-3/tier_3_icon.svg)](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/tier-3-overview)  
Tier 3

### [Adaptive ready](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/tier-3-overview)

Expand your app's possibilities on large screens. Support portrait and landscape device orientations and multi-window mode. Create layouts that fill the available app space.

[![Depiction of Tier 1 of the Adaptive app quality guidelines.](http://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/quality-guidelines/tier-1/tier_1_icon.svg)](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/tier-1-overview)  
Tier 1

### [Adaptive differentiated](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/tier-1-overview)

Make your app stand out from the app store crowd. Add differentiated features like tabletop posture on foldables for a user experience standard phones can't match.

## ...and proven canonical layouts

[![Depiction of the large screen canonical layouts.](http://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/topics/large-screens/get-started/canonical_layouts.png)](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/large-screen-canonical-layouts)  
The large screen canonical layouts---list‑detail, feed, and supporting pane---are versatile, popular UI designs. Implement the layouts in your app to provide an optimized large screen experience your users will love.
