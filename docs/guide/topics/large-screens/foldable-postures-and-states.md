TIER 1 --- Adaptive differentiated
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive differentiated](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_differentiated) by meeting the [Foldables:Postures](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Foldables:Postures) and [Foldables:Camera](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Foldables:Camera) requirements of the [Adaptive
| app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines.

Foldable postures and states such as tabletop and [`HALF_OPENED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/window/layout/FoldingFeature.State#HALF_OPENED()) invite app
innovation. A camera preview that supports both large and small screens of a
foldable device provides an optimal user experience.

Differentiate your app on premium foldable devices with Jetpack WindowManager
APIs such as [`FoldingFeature`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/window/layout/FoldingFeature).
