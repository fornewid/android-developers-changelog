TIER 1 --- Adaptive differentiated
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive differentiated](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_differentiated) by meeting the [Multitasking:Support](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Multitasking:Support) and [Multitasking:Multi-Instance](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Multitasking:Multi-Instance) requirements of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines.

The expansive screen space of large screen devices enables users to run multiple
apps or multiple instances of the same app simultaneously for an enhanced user
experience and increased productivity.

## Multitasking

Apps can run side by side in split-screen mode or in separate, movable,
resizable windows in desktop windowing. Your app can open another application in
a separate window from a deep link, open attachments in their own windows, or
play videos in picture‑in‑picture mode.

## Multi-instance

Your app can launch multiple instances of itself in separate windows for
document editing, web browsing, file management, and product comparisons.

## Next steps

To learn how to make the most of multitasking and multi‑instance use
cases, see the following developer guides:
