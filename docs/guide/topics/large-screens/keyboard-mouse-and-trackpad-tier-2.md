TIER 2 --- Adaptive optimized
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive optimized](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_optimized) by meeting the following keyboard, mouse, and trackpad requirements of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines:
|
| - [Input:Keyboard_Navigation](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Keyboard_Navigation)
| - [Input:Keyboard_Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Keyboard_Shortcuts)
| - [Input:Keyboard_Playback](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Keyboard_Playback)
| - [Input:Keyboard_Send](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Keyboard_Send)
| - [Input:Context_Menus](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Context_Menus)
| - [Input:Zoom](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Zoom)
| - [Input:Hover](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Hover)

Apps optimized for large screen devices provide an enhanced,
accessibility‑compliant user experience by supporting advanced keyboard,
mouse, and trackpad input capabilities, including:

- Keyboard navigation using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> and arrow keys
- Keyboard shortcuts for actions such as select, cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo
- Keyboard control of media playback, such as using the <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to play and pause media
- Keyboard *send* function in communication apps using the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
- Context menus accessible by mouse and trackpad right‑click behavior (secondary mouse button or secondary tap)
- App content zoom (magnification) using trackpad pinch gestures and the mouse scroll wheel with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key
- Hover states for interactive UI elements
