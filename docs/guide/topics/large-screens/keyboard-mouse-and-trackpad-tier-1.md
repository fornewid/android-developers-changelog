TIER 1 --- Adaptive differentiated
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive differentiated](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_differentiated) by meeting the following keyboard, mouse, and trackpad requirements of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines:
|
| - [Input:Keyboard_Parity](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Keyboard_Parity)
| - [Input:Combinations](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Combinations)
| - [Input:Scrollbar](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Scrollbar)
| - [Input:Hover_Parity](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Hover_Parity)
| - [Input:Desktop_Menus](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Desktop_Menus)
| - [Input:Panel_Config](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Panel_Config)
| - [Input:Triple_Click](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Triple_Click)

Adaptive differentiated apps support keyboard, mouse, and trackpad features
equivalent to those of web or desktop apps, including:

- A comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts in addition to conventional shortcuts such as <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> for copy and <kbd>Ctrl-Z</kbd> for undo
- Keyboard and mouse or trackpad combinations, such as <kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+tap</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+click</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+tap</kbd>, for enhanced capabilities such as the selection of ranges of adjacent items or multiple separated items
- Scrollbars while content is being scrolled using a mouse or trackpad
- Additional content such as fly-out menus or tooltips on mouse or trackpad hover over UI elements
- Desktop-style menus and context menus
- UI panels in multipanel layouts that are movable and resizable using a mouse or trackpad
- Triple clicking or tapping using a mouse or trackpad to select entire lines or paragraphs of text
