TIER 3 --- Adaptive ready
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive ready](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_ready) by meeting the [Stylus:Basic](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Stylus:Basic) and [Stylus:Text_Input](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Stylus:Text_Input) requirements of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality) guidelines.

Productivity and creativity apps on large screen devices are at their best when
the apps support stylus input.

Enable your users to take advantage of the natural, intuitive interactivity a
stylus provides for:

- Writing and editing text
- Scrolling through lists, pickers, and other scrollable content
