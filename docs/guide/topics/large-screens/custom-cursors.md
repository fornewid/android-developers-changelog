TIER 1 --- Adaptive differentiated
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive differentiated](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_differentiated) by meeting the [Cursors:Custom](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Cursors:Custom) requirement of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines.

Custom cursors differentiate your app by indicating how and when users can
interact with UI elements and content. The system provides default custom
cursors, such as:

- I-beam for text fields
- Resize handles at resizable layer edges
- Processing spinners

But you can create specialty cursors, such as:

- Crosshairs when hovering over targets in games
- A magnifying glass when hovering over zoomable content
- Tools in drawing or illustration apps

## Next steps
