TIER 1 --- Adaptive differentiated
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive differentiated](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_differentiated) by meeting the [Drag_Drop:Support](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Drag_Drop:Support) requirement of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines.

Apps differentiate themselves on large screens by supporting drag and drop
within the app and, in multi‑window mode, between apps using touch input,
mouse, trackpad, and stylus.
