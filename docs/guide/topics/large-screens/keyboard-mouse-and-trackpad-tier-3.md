TIER 3 --- Adaptive ready
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive ready](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_ready) by meeting the [Input:Keyboard](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Keyboard) and [Input:Mouse_Trackpad](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Input:Mouse_Trackpad) requirements of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality) guidelines.

Large screen devices often include a keyboard, mouse, or trackpad for enhanced
user input and interactivity.

Enable your app to support:

- Input from an external keyboard
- Context switching between physical and virtual keyboards
- Basic mouse and trackpad interactions, such as click, select, and scroll
