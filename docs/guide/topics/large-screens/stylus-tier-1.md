TIER 1 --- Adaptive differentiated
| **Objective:** Make your app [adaptive differentiated](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#adaptive_differentiated) by meeting the following stylus requirements of the [Adaptive app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality) guidelines:
|
| - [Stylus:Draw_Write](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Stylus:Draw_Write)
| - [Stylus:Drag_Drop](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Stylus:Drag_Drop)
| - [Stylus:Enhanced](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/adaptive-app-quality#Stylus:Enhanced)

Apps differentiated for large screen devices support drawing, writing, and
erasing with a stylus. Users can drag and drop content within an app and between
apps (in multi‑window mode) using a stylus. Apps support stylus input in
note‑taking apps.

Differentiated apps support advanced stylus features, including:

- Low latency and motion prediction for real-time responsiveness
- Pressure sensitivity for variable-width strokes
- Tilt detection for shading
- Palm and finger rejection to handle inadvertent screen touches
