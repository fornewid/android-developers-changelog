### Build accessible apps

Practicing accessible engineering is the right thing to do. It's also required for anyone designing apps for governments or large institutions. Ensure your apps are as accessible as they can be.

### Increase your app's reach

According to the World Bank, 15% of the world's population has some type of disability. People with disabilities depend on apps and services that support accessibility to communicate, learn, and work. By making your app accessible, you can reach these users.

### Improve your app's versatility

Accessibility features benefit all users. For example, if someone is using your app while they cook, they can use voice commands instead of touch gestures to navigate. Low vision features make apps useful in bright sunshine.

### Meet government and institution requirements

Many countries now require all products used by government employees to be accessible. Companies are following suit.
