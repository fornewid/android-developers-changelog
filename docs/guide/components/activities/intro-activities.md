The [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) class is a crucial component of an Android
app, and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental
part of the platform's application model. Unlike programming paradigms in
which apps are launched with a `main()` method, the Android
system initiates code in an [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) instance by
invoking specific callback methods that correspond to specific stages of
its lifecycle.


This document introduces the concept of activities, and then provides some
lightweight guidance about how to work with them.

For additional information about best practices in architecting your app,
see [Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide).

## The concept of activities


The mobile-app experience differs from its desktop counterpart in that
a user's interaction with the app doesn't always begin in the same place.
Instead, the user journey often begins non-deterministically.
For instance, if you open an email app from your home screen, you might see a
list of emails. By contrast, if you are using a social media app that then
launches your email app, you might go directly to the email app's screen for
composing an email.


The [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) class is designed to facilitate this paradigm.
When one app invokes another, the calling app invokes an activity in the other
app, rather than the app as an atomic whole. In this way, the activity serves as
the entry point for an app's interaction with the user. You implement an
activity as a subclass of the [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) class.


An activity provides the window in which the app draws
its UI. This window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the
screen and float on top of other windows. Generally, one activity
implements one screen in an app. For instance, one of an app's activities may
implement a *Preferences* screen, while another activity implements
a *Select Photo* screen.


Most apps contain multiple screens, which means they comprise multiple
activities. Typically, one activity in an app is specified as the *main
activity*, which is the first screen to appear when the user launches the app.
Each activity can then start another activity in order to
perform different actions. For example, the main activity in a simple e-mail
app may provide the screen that shows an e-mail inbox. From there, the main
activity might launch other activities that provide screens for tasks like
writing e-mails and opening individual e-mails.


Although activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in an
app, each activity is only loosely bound to the other activities; there are
usually minimal dependencies among the activities in an app. In fact,
activities often start up activities belonging to other apps. For example,
a browser app might launch the Share activity of a social-media app.


To use activities in your app, you must register information about them in
the app's manifest, and you must manage activity lifecycles appropriately.
The rest of this document introduces these subjects.

## Configuring the manifest


For your app to be able to use activities, you must declare the activities,
and certain of their attributes, in the manifest.

### Declare activities


To declare your activity, open your manifest file and add an
[\<activity\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element)
element as a child of the
[\<application\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element)
element. For example:  

```xml
<manifest ... >
  <application ... >
      <activity android:name=".ExampleActivity" />
      ...
  </application ... >
  ...
</manifest >
```


The only required attribute for this element is
[android:name](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#nm),
which specifies the class name of the activity. You can also add attributes
that define activity characteristics such as label, icon, or UI theme.
For more information about these and other attributes, see the
[\<activity\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element)
element reference documentation.


**Note:** After you publish your app,
you should not change activity
names. If you do, you might break some functionality, such as app shortcuts.
For more information on changes to avoid after publishing, see
[Things That Cannot Change](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/things-that-cannot-change.html).

### Declare intent filters


[Intent filters](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters)
are a very powerful feature of the Android platform. They
provide the ability to launch an activity based not only on an
*explicit* request, but also an *implicit* one. For example,
an explicit request might tell the system to "Start the Send Email activity
in the Gmail app". By contrast, an implicit request tells the
system to "Start a Send Email screen in any
activity that can do the job." When the system UI asks a user which app to use
in performing a task, that's an intent filter at work.


You can take advantage of this feature by declaring an
[\<intent-filter\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element)
attribute in the [\<activity\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element) element. The definition of this element includes an
[\<action\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/action-element) element and,
optionally, a
[\<category\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/category-element)
element and/or a [\<data\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/data-element)
element. These elements
combine to specify the type of intent to which your activity can respond. For
example, the following code snippet shows how to configure an activity that
sends text data, and receives requests from other activities to do so:  

```xml
<activity android:name=".ExampleActivity" android:icon="@drawable/app_icon">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```


In this
example, the [\<action\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/action-element)
element specifies that this activity sends data.
Declaring the [\<category\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/category-element)
element as `DEFAULT` enables the activity
to receive launch requests. The [\<data\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/data-element)
element specifies the type of data that
this activity can send. The following code snippet shows how to call the
activity described above:  

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val sendIntent = Intent().apply {
    action = Intent.ACTION_SEND
    type = "text/plain"
    putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, textMessage)
}
startActivity(sendIntent)
```

### Java

```java
// Create the text message with a string
Intent sendIntent = new Intent();
sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.setType("text/plain");
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, textMessage);
// Start the activity
startActivity(sendIntent);
```
If you intend for your app to be self-contained and not allow other apps to activate its activities, you don't need any other intent filters. Activities that you don't want to make available to other applications should have no intent filters, and you can start them yourself using explicit intents. For more information about how your activities can respond to intents, see [Intents
and Intent Filters](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters).

### Declare permissions


You can use the manifest's
[`<activity>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element) tag to control
which apps can start a particular activity. A parent activity cannot launch a
child activity unless both activities have the same permissions in their
manifest. If you declare a
[`<uses-permission>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-permission-element)
element for a parent activity, each child activity must have a matching
[`<uses-permission>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-permission-element)
element.


For example, if your app wants to use a hypothetical app named SocialApp
to share a post on social media, SocialApp itself must define the permission
that an app calling it must have:  

```xml
<manifest>
<activity android:name="...."
   android:permission=”com.google.socialapp.permission.SHARE_POST”

/>
```


Then, to be allowed to call SocialApp, your app must match the permission set in
SocialApp's manifest:  

```xml
<manifest>
   <uses-permission android:name="com.google.socialapp.permission.SHARE_POST" />
</manifest>
```


For more information on permissions and security in general, see
[Security and Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/security).

## Managing the activity lifecycle


Over the course of its lifetime, an activity goes through a number of states.
You use a series of callbacks to handle transitions between states. The following sections
introduce these callbacks.

### onCreate()


You must implement this callback, which fires when the system creates your
activity. Your implementation should initialize the essential components of
your activity: For example, your app should create views and bind data to
lists here. Most importantly, this is where you must call
[setContentView()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#setContentView(android.view.View))
to define the layout for the activity's user interface.


When [onCreate()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)) finishes, the
next callback is always [onStart()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onStart()).

### onStart()


As [onCreate()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)) exits, the activity
enters the Started state, and the activity becomes visible to the user.
This callback contains what amounts to the activity's final preparations for
coming to the foreground and becoming interactive.

### onResume()


The system invokes this callback just before the activity starts interacting
with the user. At this point, the activity is at the top of the activity
stack, and captures all user input. Most of an app's core functionality is
implemented in the [onResume()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onResume()) method.


The [onPause()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()) callback always
follows [onResume()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onResume()).

### onPause()


The system calls [onPause()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()) when the activity loses
focus and enters a Paused state. This state occurs when, for example, the user
taps the Back or Recents button. When the system calls
[onPause()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()) for your activity,
it technically means your activity is still partially visible, but most often is an indication that
the user is leaving the activity, and the activity will soon enter the
Stopped or Resumed state.


An activity in the Paused state may continue to update the UI if the user
is expecting the UI to update. Examples of such an activity include one showing a navigation
map screen or a media player playing. Even if such activities lose focus, the user
expects their UI to continue updating.


You should **not** use
[onPause()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()) to save application or user
data, make network calls, or execute database transactions.
For information about saving data, see [Saving and restoring activity state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#saras).


Once [onPause()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onPause()) finishes executing,
the next callback is either [onStop()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onStop()) or
[onResume()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onResume()), depending on what
happens after the activity enters the Paused state.

### onStop()


The system calls [onStop()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onStop()) when the
activity is no longer visible to the user.
This may happen because the activity is being destroyed, a new activity is
starting, or an existing activity is entering
a Resumed state and is covering the stopped activity.
In all of these cases, the stopped activity is no longer
visible at all.


The next callback that the system calls is either
[onRestart()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onRestart()), if the
activity is coming back to interact with the user, or by
[onDestroy()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onDestroy())
if this activity is completely terminating.

### onRestart()


The system invokes this callback when an activity in the Stopped state is
about to restart. [onRestart()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onRestart())
restores the state of the activity from the time that it was stopped.


This callback is always followed by
[onStart()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onStart()).

### onDestroy()


The system invokes this callback before an activity is destroyed.


This callback is the final one that the activity receives.
[onDestroy()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onDestroy()) is
usually implemented to ensure that all of an activity's resources are
released when the activity, or the process containing it, is destroyed.


This section provides only an introduction to this topic. For a more

Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle).
