# Slices are UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and interactive content from your app from within the Google Search app and also in other places like the Google Assistant. Slices can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the fullscreen app experience. You can build Slices as enhancements to[App Actions](https://developer.android.com/guide/actions).

Support for Slices is built into[Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)and can extend all the way back to Android 4.4, reaching approximately 95% of all Android users.

Check out the[getting started guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/getting-started)to start building Slices today.

## Rich and flexible layouts

Using[templates](https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/templates), you can customize your Slices with color, text, imagery, video, and more to match your app's design.
