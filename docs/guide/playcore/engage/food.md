Boost app engagement by reaching your users where they are. Integrate Engage SDK to deliver personalized recommendations and continuation content directly to users across multiple on-device surfaces, like**[Collections](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/07/introducing-collections-powered-by-engage-sdk.html)** ,**[Entertainment Space](https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space/)** , and the Play Store. The integration adds less than 50 KB (compressed) to the average APK and takes most apps about a week of developer time. Learn more at our**[business site](http://play.google.com/console/about/programs/EngageSDK)**.

This guide contains instructions for developer partners to deliver food content (food ordering, food or restaurant reviews \& discovery, meal subscriptions, recipes) to Engage content surfaces.

## Integration detail

### Terminology

This integration includes the following five cluster types:**Recommendation** ,**Featured** ,**Food Shopping Cart** ,**Food Shopping List** , and**Reorder**.

- **Recommendation**clusters show personalized food-related suggestions from an individual developer partner. These recommendations can be personalized to the user or generalized (for example, new on sale). Use them to surface recipes, stores, dishes, groceries, and so on as you see fit.

  - A Recommendation cluster can be made of`ProductEntity`,`StoreEntity`, or`RecipeEntity`listings, but not a mix of different entity types.

  ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/food-entities.png)**Figure :**\`ProductEntity\`, \`StoreEntity\`, and \`RecipeEntity\`. (\*UI for illustrative purposes only)
- The**Featured**cluster showcases a selection of entities from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping. There will be a single Featured cluster, which is surfaced near the top of the UI with a priority placement above all Recommendation clusters. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast up to 10 entities in the Featured cluster.

- The**Food Shopping Cart**cluster shows a sneak peek of grocery shopping carts from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping, prompting users to complete their outstanding carts. There is a single Food Shopping Cart cluster.

  - Food Shopping Cart Cluster must show the total count of items in the cart and may also include images for X items in the user's cart.

- The**Food Shopping List**cluster shows a sneak peek of the grocery shopping lists from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping, prompting users to return to the corresponding app to update and complete their lists. There is a single Food Shopping List cluster.

- The**Reorder**cluster shows a sneak peek of the previous orders from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping, prompting users to reorder. There is a single Reorder cluster.

  - Reorder cluster must show the total count of items in the user's previous order and must also include one of the following:

    - Images for X items in the user's previous order.
    - Labels for X items in the user's previous order.

### Pre-work

Minimum API level: 19

Add the`com.google.android.engage:engage-core`library to your app:  

    dependencies {
        // Make sure you also include that repository in your project's build.gradle file.
        implementation 'com.google.android.engage:engage-core:1.5.11'
    }

### Summary

The design is based on an implementation of a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

The data a client can publish is subject to the following limits for different cluster types:

|        Cluster type        | Cluster limits |              Maximum entity limits in a cluster              |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommendation Cluster(s)  | At most 7      | At most 50 (`ProductEntity`,`RecipeEntity`, or`StoreEntity`) |
| Featured Cluster           | At most 1      | At most 20 (`ProductEntity`,`RecipeEntity`, or`StoreEntity`) |
| Food Shopping Cart Cluster | At most 1      | At most 3`FoodShoppingCart`                                  |
| Food Shopping List Cluster | At most 1      | At most 3`FoodShoppingList`                                  |
| Food Reorder Cluster       | At most 1      | At most 1`ReorderEntity`                                     |

### Step 1: Provide entity data

The SDK has defined different entities to represent each item type. We support the following entities for the Food category:

1. `ProductEntity`
2. `StoreEntity`
3. `RecipeEntity`
4. `FoodShoppingCart`
5. `FoodShoppingList`
6. `FoodReorderCluster`

The charts below outline available attributes and requirements for each type.

#### `ProductEntity`

The`ProductEntity`object represents an individual item (such as a grocery item, dish from a restaurant, or a promotion) that developer partners want to publish.

It is recommended to have the content publish job executed in the background (for example, using[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)) and scheduled on a regular basis or on an event basis (for example, every time the user opens the app or when the user just added something to their cart).

`AppEngageFoodClient`is responsible for publishing food clusters.

There are following APIs to publish clusters in the client:

- `isServiceAvailable`
- `publishRecommendationClusters`
- `publishFeaturedCluster`
- `publishFoodShoppingCarts`
- `publishFoodShoppingLists`
- `publishReorderCluster`
- `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`
- `updatePublishStatus`
- `deleteRecommendationsClusters`
- `deleteFeaturedCluster`
- `deleteFoodShoppingCartCluster`
- `deleteFoodShoppingListCluster`
- `deleteReorderCluster`
- `deleteUserManagementCluster`
- `deleteClusters`

#### `isServiceAvailable`

This API is used to check if the service is available for integration and whether the content can be presented on the device.  

### Kotlin

    client.isServiceAvailable.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Handle IPC call success
            if(task.result) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    }

### Java

    client.isServiceAvailable().addOnCompleteListener(task - > {
        if (task.isSuccessful()) {
            // Handle success
            if(task.getResult()) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    });

| **Note:** We highly recommend keeping a periodic job running to check if the service becomes available at a later point in time. The availability of the service may change with Android version upgrades, app upgrades, installs, and uninstalls. By ensuring periodic job checks at a certain time interval, data can be published once the service becomes available.

#### `publishRecommendationClusters`

This API is used to publish a list of`RecommendationCluster`objects.

A`RecommendationCluster`object can have the following attributes:

|                      Attribute                      | Requirement  |                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                       |

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`UserAccountManagementCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated UserAccountManagementCluster Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `updatePublishStatus`

If for any internal business reason, none of the clusters is published, we**strongly recommend** updating the publish status using the**updatePublishStatus**API. This is important because :

- Providing the status in all scenarios, even when the content is published (STATUS == PUBLISHED), is critical to populate dashboards that use this explicit status to convey the health and other metrics of your integration.
- If no content is published but the integration status isn't broken (STATUS == NOT_PUBLISHED), Google can avoid triggering alerts in the app health dashboards. It confirms that content is not published due to an**expected**situation from the provider's standpoint.
- It helps developers provide insights into when the data is published versus not.
- Google may use the status codes to nudge the user to do certain actions in the app so they can see the app content or overcome it.

The list of eligible publish status codes are :  

    // Content is published
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.PUBLISHED,

    // Content is not published as user is not signed in
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN,

    // Content is not published as user is not subscribed
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SUBSCRIPTION,

    // Content is not published as user location is ineligible
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_INELIGIBLE_LOCATION,

    // Content is not published as there is no eligible content
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_NO_ELIGIBLE_CONTENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature is disabled by the client
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_CLIENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a client error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_CLIENT_ERROR,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a service error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_SERVICE_ERROR,

    // Content is not published due to some other reason
    // Reach out to engage-developers@ before using this enum.
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_OTHER

If the content is not published due to a user not logged in, Google would recommend publishing the Sign In Card. If for any reason providers are not able to publish the Sign In Card then we recommend calling the**updatePublishStatus** API with the status code**NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN**  

### Kotlin

    client.updatePublishStatus(
       PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
         .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
         .build())

### Java

    client.updatePublishStatus(
        new PublishStatusRequest.Builder()

          .addClusterType(ClusterType.TYPE_RECOMMENDATION)
          ...
          .build())

### Java

    client.deleteClusters(
                new DeleteClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addClusterType(ClusterType.TYPE_FEATURED)
                    .addClusterType(ClusterType.TYPE_RECOMMENDATION)
                    ...
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from all clusters matching the specified cluster types. Clients can choose to pass one or many cluster types. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### Error handling

It is highly recommended to listen to the task result from the publish APIs such that a follow-up action can be taken to recover and resubmit an successful task.  

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                  new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                      .addRecommendationCluster(...)
                      .build())
              .addOnCompleteListener(
                  task -> {
                    if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                      // do something
                    } else {
                      Exception exception = task.getException();
                      if (exception instanceof AppEngageException) {
                        @AppEngageErrorCode
                        int errorCode = ((AppEngageException) exception).getErrorCode();
                        if (errorCode == AppEngageErrorCode.SERVICE_NOT_FOUND) {
                          // do something
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  });

The error is returned as an`AppEngageException`with the cause included as an error code.

| Error code |            Error name             |                                                                  Note                                                                   |

| `4`        | `SERVICE_CALL_PERMISSION_DENIED`  | The caller is not allowed to make the service call.                                                                                     |
| `5`        | `SERVICE_CALL_INVALID_ARGUMENT`   | The request contains invalid data (for example, more than the allowed number of clusters).                                              |
| `6`        | `SERVICE_CALL_INTERNAL`           | There is an error on the service side.                                                                                                  |
| `7`        | `SERVICE_CALL_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | The service call is made too frequently.                                                                                                |

### Step 3: Handle broadcast intents

In addition to making publish content API calls through a job, it is also required to set up a[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)to receive the request for a content publish.

The goal of broadcast intents is mainly for app reactivation and forcing data sync. Broadcast intents are not designed to be sent very frequently. It is only triggered when the Engage Service determines the content might be stale (for example, a week old). That way, there is more confidence that the user can have a fresh content experience, even if the application has not been executed for a long period of time.

The`BroadcastReceiver`must be set up in the following two ways:

- Dynamically register an instance of the`BroadcastReceiver`class using`Context.registerReceiver()`. This enables communication from applications that are still live in memory.

### Kotlin

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver(){
      // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION
      // broadcast is received
      // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is
      // received
      // Trigger food shopping cart cluster publish when PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_CART broadcast
      // is received
      // Trigger food shopping list cluster publish when PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_LIST broadcast
      // is received
      // Trigger reorder cluster publish when PUBLISH_REORDER_CLUSTER broadcast is
      // received
    }

    fun registerBroadcastReceivers(context: Context){
      var  context = context
      context = context.applicationContext

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register food Shopping Cart Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_CART),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register food Shopping List Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_LIST),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Reorder Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_REORDER_CLUSTER),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)
    }

### Java

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
    // is received

    // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received

    // Trigger food shopping cart cluster publish when PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_CART broadcast is
    // received

    // Trigger food shopping list cluster publish when PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_LIST broadcast is
    // received

    // Trigger reorder cluster publish when PUBLISH_REORDER_CLUSTER broadcast is
    // received
    }

    public static void registerBroadcastReceivers(Context context) {

    context = context.getApplicationContext();

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register food Shopping Cart Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.shopping.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_CART),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register food Shopping List Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.shopping.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_LIST),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Reorder Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.shopping.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_REORDER_CLUSTER),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    }

- Statically declare an implementation with the`<receiver>`tag in your`AndroidManifest.xml`file. This allows the application to receive broadcast intents when it is not running, and also allows the application to publish the content.

    <application>
       <receiver
          android:name=".AppEngageBroadcastReceiver"
          android:permission="com.google.android.engage.REQUEST_ENGAGE_DATA"
          android:exported="true"
          android:enabled="true">
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.food.PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_CART" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.food.PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_LIST" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.food.PUBLISH_REORDER_CLUSTER" />
          </intent-filter>
       </receiver>
    </application>

The following[intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)will be sent by the service:

- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION`It is recommended to start a`publishRecommendationClusters`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED`It is recommended to start a`publishFeaturedCluster`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.food.PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_CART`It is recommended to start a`publishFoodShoppingCarts`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.food.PUBLISH_FOOD_SHOPPING_LIST`It is recommended to start a`publishFoodShoppingLists`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.food.PUBLISH_REORDER_CLUSTER`It is recommended to start a`publishReorderCluster`call when receiving this intent.
