Google is building an on-device surface that organizes users' apps by verticals and enables a new immersive experience for personalized app content consumption and discovery. This fullscreen experience provides developer partners with an opportunity to showcase their best rich content in a dedicated channel outside of their app.This guide contains instructions for developer partners to integrate their dating content, using the Engage SDK to populate this new surface area.

## Integration detail

### Terminology

This integration includes the following three cluster types:**Recommendation** ,**Featured** , and**Continuation**.

- **Recommendation**clusters show personalized dating suggestions from an individual developer partner. These recommendations can be personalized to the user.

  - A Recommendation cluster can be made of`ArticleEntity`,`PersonEntity`, or`EventEntity`but not a mix of different entity types.

  Your recommendations take the following structure:
  - **Recommendation Cluster:**A UI view that contains a group of recommendations from the same developer partner.

  - **Entity:**An object representing a single item in a cluster. This integration offers some entities that would be surfaced using the Recommendation Cluster:

    - **ArticleEntity**: ArticleEntity represents a recommendation for text-based content that is related to dating. ArticleEntity item allows developers to provide a variety of text and image content with more metadata to articulate the information to the users.

    - **PersonEntity**: PersonEntity represents a person. The recommendations could be to highlight a person in the dating prospects.

    - **EventEntity**: EventEntity represents an event happening in the future. Event start time is a critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users.

- The**Continuation**cluster shows content recently engaged by users from multiple developer partners in a single UI grouping. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast a maximum of 10 entities in the Continuation cluster.

  Your continuation content can take the following structure:
  - **ArticleEntity**: ArticleEntity represents a recommendation for text-based content that is related to dating. This entity can be used to represent unfinished news articles or other content that the user would like to continue consuming from where they left it.

  - **EventReservationEntity**: EventReservationEntity represents reservation for an event and helps users track upcoming or ongoing dating and meetup event reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/event-reservation-entity-dating.png)**Figure 8.**UI showing a single EventReservationEntity within a Continuation cluster.
- The**Featured** cluster is a UI view that showcases the chosen hero`GenericFeaturedEntity`from many developer partners in one UI grouping. There is a single Featured cluster, which is surfaced near the top of the UI, with a priority placement above all Recommendation clusters. Each developer partner is allowed to broadcast a single entity of a supported type in Featured, with many entities (potentially of different types) from multiple app developers in the Featured cluster.

  - **GenericFeaturedEntity**: GenericFeaturedEntity differs from Recommendation item in that Featured item should be used for a single top content from developers and should represent the single most important content that will be interesting and relevant to users.

### Pre-work

Minimum API level: 19

Add the`com.google.android.engage:engage-core`library to your app:  

    dependencies {
        // Make sure you also include that repository in your project's build.gradle file.
        implementation 'com.google.android.engage:engage-core:1.5.11'
    }

### Summary

The design is based on an implementation of a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

The data a client can publish is subject to the following limits for different cluster types:

|       Cluster type        | Cluster limits | Minimum entity limits in a cluster |              Maximum entity limits in a cluster              |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommendation Cluster(s) | At most 5      | At least 5                         | At most 25 (`ArticleEntity`,`PersonEntity`, or`EventEntity`) |
| Continuation Cluster      | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 10 (`ArticleEntity`, or`EventReservationEntity`)     |
| Featured Cluster          | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 10 (`GenericFeaturedEntity`)                         |

### Step 1: Provide entity data

The SDK has defined different entities to represent each item type. We support the following entities for the Dating category:

1. `GenericFeaturedEntity`
2. `ArticleEntity`
3. `PersonEntity`
4. `EventEntity`
5. `EventReservationEntity`

The charts below outline available attributes and requirements for each type.

#### Image specifications

Required specifications for image assets are listed in this table:

|        Aspect ratio        | Minimum pixels | Recommended pixels |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Square (1x1) **Preferred** | 300x300        | 1200x1200          |
| Landscape (1.91x1)         | 600x314        | 1200x628           |
| Portrait (4x5)             | 480x600        | 960x1200           |

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*File formats*

PNG, JPG, static GIF, WebP

*Maximum file size*

5120 KB

*Additional recommendations*

- **Image safe area:**Put your important content in the center 80% of the image.
- Use a transparent background so that the image can be properly displayed in Dark and Light theme settings.

#### Content Category

The content category allows apps to publish content belonging to multiple categories. This maps the content with some of the predefined categories namely:

- `TYPE_EDUCATION`
- `TYPE_SPORTS`
- `TYPE_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS`
- `TYPE_BOOKS`
- `TYPE_AUDIOBOOKS`
- `TYPE_MUSIC`
- `TYPE_DIGITAL_GAMES`
- `TYPE_TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL`
- `TYPE_HOME_AND_AUTO`
- `TYPE_BUSINESS`
- `TYPE_NEWS`
- `TYPE_FOOD_AND_DRINK`
- `TYPE_SHOPPING`
- `TYPE_HEALTH_AND_FITENESS`
- `TYPE_MEDICAL`
- `TYPE_PARENTING`
- `TYPE_DATING`

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*Guidelines to use the content categories*

1. Some entities like**ArticleEntity** and**GenericFeaturedEntity** are eligible to use any of the content categories. For other entities like**EventEntity** ,**EventReservationEntity** ,**PersonEntity**, only a subset of these categories are eligible. Check the list of categories eligible for an entity type before populating the list.
2. Use the specific entity type for some content categories over a combination of the Generic entities and the ContentCategory:

   - TYPE_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS - Check out the entities from[Watch integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_BOOKS - Check out the[EbookEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/read#ebookentity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_AUDIOBOOKS - Check out[AudiobookEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/read#audiobookentity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_SHOPPING - Check out[ShoppingEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/shopping#shoppingEntity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_FOOD_AND_DRINK - Check out entities from[Food Integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/food)before using the generic entities.
3. The ContentCategory field is optional and should be left blank if the content doesn't belong to any of the categories mentioned earlier.

4. In case multiple content categories are provided, provide them in the order of relevance to the content with the most relevant content category placed first in the list.

### Step 2: Provide Cluster data

It is recommended to have the content publish job executed in the background (for example, using[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)) and scheduled on a regular basis or on an event basis (for example, every time the user opens the app or when the user just added something to their cart).

`AppEngagePublishClient`is responsible for publishing clusters.

There are following APIs to publish clusters in the client:

- `isServiceAvailable`
- `publishRecommendationClusters`
- `publishFeaturedCluster`
- `publishContinuationCluster`
- `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`
- `updatePublishStatus`
- `deleteRecommendationsClusters`
- `deleteFeaturedCluster`
- `deleteContinuationCluster`
- `deleteUserManagementCluster`
- `deleteClusters`

#### `isServiceAvailable`

This API is used to check if the service is available for integration and whether the content can be presented on the device.  

### Kotlin

    client.isServiceAvailable.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Handle IPC call success
            if(task.result) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    }

### Java

    client.isServiceAvailable().addOnCompleteListener(task - > {
        if (task.isSuccessful()) {
            // Handle success
            if(task.getResult()) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    });

| **Note:** We highly recommend keeping a periodic job running to check if the service becomes available at a later point in time. The availability of the service may change with Android version upgrades, app upgrades, installs, and uninstalls. By ensuring periodic job checks at a certain time interval, data can be published once the service becomes available.

#### `publishRecommendationClusters`

This API is used to publish a list of`RecommendationCluster`objects.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
          PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
            .addRecommendationCluster(
              RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                .addEntity(entity1)
                .addEntity(entity2)
                .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                .build()
            )
            .build()
        )

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addRecommendationCluster(
                        new RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                            .addEntity(entity1)
                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`RecommendationCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Recommendation Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishFeaturedCluster`

This API is used to publish a list of`FeaturedCluster`objects.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishFeaturedCluster(
        PublishFeaturedClusterRequest.Builder()
          .setFeaturedCluster(
            FeaturedCluster.Builder()
              .addEntity(entity1)
              .addEntity(entity2)
              .build())
          .build())

### Java

    client.publishFeaturedCluster(
                new PublishFeaturedClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addFeaturedCluster(
                        new FeaturedCluster.Builder()
                            .addEntity(entity1)
                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`FeaturedCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Featured Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishContinuationCluster`

This API is used to publish a`ContinuationCluster`object.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishContinuationCluster(
        PublishContinuationClusterRequest.Builder()
          .setContinuationCluster(
            ContinuationCluster.Builder()
              .addEntity(entity1)
              .addEntity(entity2)
              .build())
          .build())

### Java

    client.publishContinuationCluster(
                new PublishContinuationClusterRequest.Builder()
                    .setContinuationCluster(
                        new ContinuationCluster.Builder()
                            .addEntity(entity1)
                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`ContinuationCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Continuation Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`

This API is used to publish a Sign In card . The signin action directs users to the app's sign in page so that the app can publish content (or provide more personalized content)

The following metadata is part of the Sign In Card -

|  Attribute  |                    Requirement                     |                                  Description                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action Uri  | Required                                           | Deeplink to Action (i.e. navigates to app sign in page)                        |
| Image       | Optional - If not provided, Title must be provided | Image Shown on the Card 16x9 aspect ratio images with a resolution of 1264x712 |
| Title       | Optional - If not provided, Image must be provided | Title on the Card                                                              |
| Action Text | Optional                                           | Text Shown on the CTA (i.e. Sign in)                                           |
| Subtitle    | Optional                                           | Optional Subtitle on the Card                                                  |

**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    var SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY =
          SignInCardEntity.Builder()
              .addPosterImage(
                  Image.Builder()
                      .setImageUri(Uri.parse("http://www.x.com/image.png"))
                      .setImageHeightInPixel(500)
                      .setImageWidthInPixel(500)
                      .build())
              .setActionText("Sign In")
              .setActionUri(Uri.parse("http://xx.com/signin"))
              .build()

    client.publishUserAccountManagementRequest(
                PublishUserAccountManagementRequest.Builder()
                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

### Java

    SignInCardEntity SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY =
          new SignInCardEntity.Builder()
              .addPosterImage(
                  new Image.Builder()
                      .setImageUri(Uri.parse("http://www.x.com/image.png"))
                      .setImageHeightInPixel(500)
                      .setImageWidthInPixel(500)
                      .build())
              .setActionText("Sign In")
              .setActionUri(Uri.parse("http://xx.com/signin"))
              .build();

    client.publishUserAccountManagementRequest(
                new PublishUserAccountManagementRequest.Builder()
                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`UserAccountManagementCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated UserAccountManagementCluster Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `updatePublishStatus`

If for any internal business reason, none of the clusters is published, we**strongly recommend** updating the publish status using the**updatePublishStatus**API. This is important because :

- Providing the status in all scenarios, even when the content is published (STATUS == PUBLISHED), is critical to populate dashboards that use this explicit status to convey the health and other metrics of your integration.
- If no content is published but the integration status isn't broken (STATUS == NOT_PUBLISHED), Google can avoid triggering alerts in the app health dashboards. It confirms that content is not published due to an**expected**situation from the provider's standpoint.
- It helps developers provide insights into when the data is published versus not.
- Google may use the status codes to nudge the user to do certain actions in the app so they can see the app content or overcome it.

The list of eligible publish status codes are :  

    // Content is published
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.PUBLISHED,

    // Content is not published as user is not signed in
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN,

    // Content is not published as user is not subscribed
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SUBSCRIPTION,

    // Content is not published as user location is ineligible
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_INELIGIBLE_LOCATION,

    // Content is not published as there is no eligible content
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_NO_ELIGIBLE_CONTENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature is disabled by the client
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_CLIENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a client error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_CLIENT_ERROR,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a service error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_SERVICE_ERROR,

    // Content is not published due to some other reason
    // Reach out to engage-developers@ before using this enum.
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_OTHER

If the content is not published due to a user not logged in, Google would recommend publishing the Sign In Card. If for any reason providers are not able to publish the Sign In Card then we recommend calling the**updatePublishStatus** API with the status code**NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN**  

### Kotlin

    client.updatePublishStatus(
       PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
         .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
         .build())

### Java

    client.updatePublishStatus(
        new PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
            .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
            .build());

#### `deleteRecommendationClusters`

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from all clusters matching the specified cluster types. Clients can choose to pass one or many cluster types. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### Error handling

It is highly recommended to listen to the task result from the publish APIs such that a follow-up action can be taken to recover and resubmit an successful task.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
            PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
              .addRecommendationCluster(..)
              .build())
          .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
            if (task.isSuccessful) {
              // do something
            } else {
              val exception = task.exception

                }
              }
            }

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(

                    } else {
                      Exception exception = task.getException();

### Step 3: Handle broadcast intents

In addition to making publish content API calls through a job, it is also required to set up a[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)to receive the request for a content publish.

The goal of broadcast intents is mainly for app reactivation and forcing data sync. Broadcast intents are not designed to be sent very frequently. It is only triggered when the Engage Service determines the content might be stale (for example, a week old). That way, there is more confidence that the user can have a fresh content experience, even if the application has not been executed for a long period of time.

The`BroadcastReceiver`must be set up in the following two ways:

- Dynamically register an instance of the`BroadcastReceiver`class using`Context.registerReceiver()`. This enables communication from applications that are still live in memory.

### Kotlin

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver(){
      // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
      // is received
      // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received
      // Trigger continuation cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUATION broadcast is
      // received
    }

    fun registerBroadcastReceivers(context: Context){
      var  context = context
      context = context.applicationContext

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Continuation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_CONTINUATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)
    }

### Java

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
    // is received

    // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received

    // Trigger continuation cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUATION broadcast is
    // received
    }

    public static void registerBroadcastReceivers(Context context) {

    context = context.getApplicationContext();

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                              new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                              com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                              /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Continuation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_CONTINUATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    }

- Statically declare an implementation with the`<receiver>`tag in your`AndroidManifest.xml`file. This allows the application to receive broadcast intents when it is not running, and also allows the application to publish the content.

    <application>
       <receiver
          android:name=".AppEngageBroadcastReceiver"
          android:permission="com.google.android.engage.REQUEST_ENGAGE_DATA"
          android:exported="true"
          android:enabled="true">
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_CONTINUATION" />
          </intent-filter>
       </receiver>
    </application>

The following[intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)is sent by the service:

- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION`It is recommended to start a`publishRecommendationClusters`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED`It is recommended to start a`publishFeaturedCluster`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_CONTINUATION`It is recommended to start a`publishContinuationCluster`call when receiving this intent.
