Boost app engagement by reaching your users where they are. Integrate Engage SDK to deliver personalized recommendations and continuation content directly to users across multiple on-device surfaces, like**[Collections](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/07/introducing-collections-powered-by-engage-sdk.html)** ,**[Entertainment Space](https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space/)** , and the Play Store. The integration adds less than 50 KB (compressed) to the average APK and takes most apps about a week of developer time. Learn more at our**[business site](http://play.google.com/console/about/programs/EngageSDK)**.

This guide contains instructions for developer partners to deliver social media content to Engage content surfaces.

## Integration detail

The following section captures the integration detail.

### Terminology

***Recommendation***clusters show personalized suggestions from an individual developer partner.

Your recommendations take the following structure:

**Recommendation Cluster**: UI view that contains a group of recommendations from the same developer partner.

Each Recommendation Cluster consists of one of the following two types of entities :

- PortraitMediaEntity
- SocialPostEntity

**PortraitMediaEntity**must contain 1 portrait image for the post. Profile and Interaction related metadata are optional.

- Post

  - Image in portrait mode and Timestamp, or
  - Image in portrait mode + text content and Timestamp
- Profile

  - Avatar, Name or Handle, Additional image
- Interactions

  - Count and label only, or
  - Count and visual (icon)

**SocialPostEntity**contains profile, post and interaction related metadata.

- Profile

  - Avatar, Name or Handle, additional text, additional image
- Post

  - Text and Timestamp, or
  - Rich media (image or rich URL) and Timestamp, or
  - Text and rich media (image or rich URL) and Timestamp, or
  - Video preview (thumbnail and duration) and Timestamp
- Interactions

  - Count \& label only, or
  - Count \& visual (icon)

### Pre-work

Minimum API level: 19

Add the`com.google.android.engage:engage-core`library to your app:  

    dependencies {
        // Make sure you also include that repository in your project's build.gradle file.
        implementation 'com.google.android.engage:engage-core:1.5.11'
    }

### Summary

The design is based on an implementation of a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

The data a client can publish is subject to the following limits for different cluster types:

|       Cluster type        | Cluster limits |            Minimum entity limits in a cluster            |            Maximum entity limits in a cluster            |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommendation Cluster(s) | At most 7      | At least 1 (`PortraitMediaEntity`, or`SocialPostEntity`) | At most 50 (`PortraitMediaEntity`, or`SocialPostEntity`) |

### Step 1: Provide entity data

The SDK has defined different entities to represent each item type. The SDK supports the following entities for the Social category:

1. `PortraitMediaEntity`
2. `SocialPostEntity`

The charts below outline available attributes and requirements for each type.

#### `PortraitMediaEntity`

If not set, content is eligible to be shown on the surface.                                                                                                                                                                   | Epoch timestamp in milliseconds                                                                                |

#### Image specifications

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*File formats*

PNG, JPG, static GIF, WebP

*Maximum file size*

5120 KB

*Additional recommendations*

- **Image safe area:**Put your important content in the center 80% of the image.
- Use a transparent background so that the image can be properly displayed in Dark and Light theme settings.

### Step 2: Provide Cluster data

It is recommended to have the content publish job executed in the background (for example, using[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)) and scheduled on a regular basis or on an event basis (for example, every time the user opens the app or when the user just followed a new account)

`AppEngageSocialClient`is responsible for publishing social clusters.

There are following APIs to publish clusters in the client:

- `isServiceAvailable`
- `publishRecommendationClusters`
- `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`
- `updatePublishStatus`
- `deleteRecommendationsClusters`
- `deleteUserManagementCluster`
- `deleteClusters`

#### `isServiceAvailable`

This API is used to check if the service is available for integration and whether the content can be presented on the device.  

### Kotlin

    client.isServiceAvailable.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Handle IPC call success
            if(task.result) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content
              // publish calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    }

### Java

    client.isServiceAvailable().addOnCompleteListener(task - > {
        if (task.isSuccessful()) {
            // Handle success
            if(task.getResult()) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content
              // publish calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    });

| **Note:** We highly recommend keeping a periodic job running to check if the service becomes available at a later point in time. The availability of the service may change with Android version upgrades, app upgrades, installs, and uninstalls. By ensuring periodic job checks at a certain time interval, data can be published once the service becomes available.

#### `publishRecommendationClusters`

This API is used to publish a list`RecommendationCluster`objects.

A`RecommendationCluster`object can have the following attributes:

|                    Attribute                     | Requirement  |                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List of SocialPostEntity, or PortraitMediaEntity | **Required** | A list of entities that make up the recommendations for this Recommendation Cluster. Entities in a single cluster must be of the same type.                                                                                                            |
| Title                                            | **Required** | The title for the Recommendation Cluster (for example,*Latest from your friends*). **Recommended text size: under 25 chars**(Text that is too long may show ellipses)                                                                                  |
| Subtitle                                         | Optional     | The subtitle for the Recommendation Cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Action Uri                                       | Optional     | The deep link to the page in the partner app where users can see the complete list of recommendations. Note: You can use deep links for attribution.[Refer to this FAQ](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/faq#deeplinks-attribution) |

| **Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.
**Important:** For social apps, it's critical to update recommendations after each app usage. Social app users are more interested in the most recent recommendations and ideally would like to see a post at most once.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addRecommendationCluster(
                        RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                            .addEntity(entity1)
                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .setTitle("Latest from your friends")
                            .build())
                    .build())

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addRecommendationCluster(
                        new RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                            .addEntity(entity1)
                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .setTitle("Latest from your friends")
                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- All existing Recommendation Cluster data is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in new Recommendation Clusters.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`

This API is used to publish a Sign In card . The signin action directs users to the app's sign in page so that the app can publish content (or provide more personalized content)

The following metadata is part of the Sign In Card -

|  Attribute  |                    Requirement                     |                                  Description                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action Uri  | Required                                           | Deeplink to Action (i.e. navigates to app sign in page)                        |
| Image       | Optional - If not provided, Title must be provided | Image Shown on the Card 16x9 aspect ratio images with a resolution of 1264x712 |
| Title       | Optional - If not provided, Image must be provided | Title on the Card                                                              |
| Action Text | Optional                                           | Text Shown on the CTA (i.e. Sign in)                                           |
| Subtitle    | Optional                                           | Optional Subtitle on the Card                                                  |

**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    var SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY =
          SignInCardEntity.Builder()
              .addPosterImage(
                  Image.Builder()
                      .setImageUri(Uri.parse("http://www.x.com/image.png"))
                      .setImageHeightInPixel(500)
                      .setImageWidthInPixel(500)
                      .build())
              .setActionText("Sign In")
              .setActionUri(Uri.parse("http://xx.com/signin"))
              .build()

    client.publishUserAccountManagementRequest(
                PublishUserAccountManagementRequest.Builder()
                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

### Java

    SignInCardEntity SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY =
          new SignInCardEntity.Builder()
              .addPosterImage(
                  new Image.Builder()
                      .setImageUri(Uri.parse("http://www.x.com/image.png"))
                      .setImageHeightInPixel(500)
                      .setImageWidthInPixel(500)
                      .build())
              .setActionText("Sign In")
              .setActionUri(Uri.parse("http://xx.com/signin"))
              .build();

    client.publishUserAccountManagementRequest(
                new PublishUserAccountManagementRequest.Builder()
                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`UserAccountManagementCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated UserAccountManagementCluster Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `updatePublishStatus`

If for any internal business reason, none of the clusters is published, we**strongly recommend** updating the publish status using the**updatePublishStatus**API. This is important because :

- Providing the status in all scenarios, even when the content is published (STATUS == PUBLISHED), is critical to populate dashboards that use this explicit status to convey the health and other metrics of your integration.
- If no content is published but the integration status isn't broken (STATUS == NOT_PUBLISHED), Google can avoid triggering alerts in the app health dashboards. It confirms that content is not published due to an**expected**situation from the provider's standpoint.
- It helps developers provide insights into when the data is published versus not.
- Google may use the status codes to nudge the user to do certain actions in the app so they can see the app content or overcome it.

The list of eligible publish status codes are :  

    // Content is published
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.PUBLISHED,

    // Content is not published as user is not signed in
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN,

    // Content is not published as user is not subscribed
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SUBSCRIPTION,

    // Content is not published as user location is ineligible
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_INELIGIBLE_LOCATION,

    // Content is not published as there is no eligible content
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_NO_ELIGIBLE_CONTENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature is disabled by the client
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_CLIENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a client error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_CLIENT_ERROR,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a service error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_SERVICE_ERROR,

    // Content is not published due to some other reason
    // Reach out to engage-developers@ before using this enum.
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_OTHER

If the content is not published due to a user not logged in, Google would recommend publishing the Sign In Card. If for any reason providers are not able to publish the Sign In Card then we recommend calling the**updatePublishStatus** API with the status code**NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN**  

### Kotlin

    client.updatePublishStatus(
       PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
         .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
         .build())

### Java

    client.updatePublishStatus(
        new PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
            .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
            .build());

#### `deleteRecommendationClusters`

This API is used to delete the content of Recommendation Clusters.
**Important:** Delete APIs should only be called when there is no content to publish.**Don't** call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently. Reach out to[`engage-developers@google.com`](mailto:engage-developers@google.com)before using delete APIs.  

### Kotlin

    client.deleteRecommendationClusters()

### Java

    client.deleteRecommendationClusters();

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from the Recommendation Clusters. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `deleteUserManagementCluster`

This API is used to delete the content of UserAccountManagement Cluster.
**Important:** Delete APIs should only be called when there is no content to publish.**Don't** call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently. Reach out to[`engage-developers@google.com`](mailto:engage-developers@google.com)before using delete APIs.  

### Kotlin

    client.deleteUserManagementCluster()

### Java

    client.deleteUserManagementCluster();

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from the UserAccountManagement Cluster. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `deleteClusters`

This API is used to delete the content of a given cluster type.
**Important:** Delete APIs should only be called when there is no content to publish.**Don't** call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently. Reach out to[`engage-developers@google.com`](mailto:engage-developers@google.com)before using delete APIs.  

### Kotlin

    client.deleteClusters(
        DeleteClustersRequest.Builder()
          .addClusterType(ClusterType.TYPE_RECOMMENDATION)
          ...
          .build())

### Java

    client.deleteClusters(
                new DeleteClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addClusterType(ClusterType.TYPE_RECOMMENDATION)
                    ...
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from all clusters matching the specified cluster types. Clients can choose to pass one or many cluster types. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### Error handling

It is highly recommended to listen to the task result from the publish APIs such that a follow-up action can be taken to recover and resubmit an successful task.  

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                  new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                      .addRecommendationCluster(...)
                      .build())
              .addOnCompleteListener(
                  task -> {
                    if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                      // do something
                    } else {
                      Exception exception = task.getException();
                      if (exception instanceof AppEngageException) {
                        @AppEngageErrorCode
                        int errorCode = ((AppEngageException) exception).getErrorCode();
                        if (errorCode == AppEngageErrorCode.SERVICE_NOT_FOUND) {
                          // do something
                        }

### Step 3: Handle broadcast intents

In addition to making publish content API calls through a job, it is also required to set up a[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)to receive the request for a content publish.

The goal of broadcast intents is mainly for app reactivation and forcing data sync. Broadcast intents are not designed to be sent very frequently. It is only triggered when the Engage Service determines the content might be stale (for example, a week old). That way, there is more confidence that the user can have a fresh content experience, even if the application has not been executed for a long period of time.

The`BroadcastReceiver`must be set up in the following two ways:

- Dynamically register an instance of the`BroadcastReceiver`class using`Context.registerReceiver()`. This enables communication from applications that are still live in memory.

### Kotlin

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver(){
      // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION
      // broadcast is received
    }

    fun registerBroadcastReceivers(context: Context){
      var  context = context
      context = context.applicationContext

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)
    }

### Java

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
    // is received
    }

    public static void registerBroadcastReceivers(Context context) {

    context = context.getApplicationContext();

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);
    }

- Statically declare an implementation with the`<receiver>`tag in your`AndroidManifest.xml`file. This allows the application to receive broadcast intents when it is not running, and also allows the application to publish the content.

    <application>
       <receiver
          android:name=".AppEngageBroadcastReceiver"
          android:permission="com.google.android.engage.REQUEST_ENGAGE_DATA"
          android:exported="true">;
         < andro>id:enabled="<true"
          intent-filter
             action android:name="com.google.an>droid.e<ngage.action.P>UBLI<SH_RECOMM>E<NDATION">; /
          /intent-filter
       /receiver
    /application

The following[intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)will be sent by the service:

- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION`It is recommended to start a`publishRecommendationClusters`call when receiving this intent.
