| **Important:** Engage SDK has superseded Media Home, which is now deprecated. If you have an existing Media Home integration, follow the instructions in these guides to migrate your content to Engage SDK, which allows your content to be published to more devices and form factors. Please contact[`engage-developers@google.com`](mailto:engage-developers@google.com)if you have any questions.

Boost app engagement by reaching your users where they are. Integrate Engage SDK to deliver Continue Watching content and personalized recommendations directly to users across multiple on-device surfaces**[Collections](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/07/introducing-collections-powered-by-engage-sdk.html)** ,**[Entertainment Space](https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space/)** , and the Play Store. The integration adds less than 50 KB (compressed) to the average APK and takes most apps about a week of developer time. Learn more at our**[business site](http://play.google.com/console/about/programs/EngageSDK)**.

This guide contains instructions for developer partners to integrate their video content, using the Engage SDK to populate both this new surface area and existing Google surfaces.
| **Note:** Check the[TV integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/tv)to learn more about the Continue Watching experience on Google TV.

## Integration detail

### Terminology

This integration includes the following three cluster types:**Recommendation** ,**Continuation** , and**Featured**.

- **Recommendation**clusters show personalized suggestions for content to watch from an individual developer partner.

  Your recommendations take the following structure:
  - **Recommendation Cluster:**A UI view that contains a group of recommendations from the same developer partner.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/watch-term-1.png)**Figure 1.**Entertainment Space UI showing a Recommendation Cluster from a single partner.
  - **Entity:** An object representing a single item in a cluster. An entity can be a movie, a TV show, a TV series, live video, and more. See the[Provide entity data](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#provide-entity-data)section for a list of supported entity types.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/watch-term-2.png)**Figure 2.**Entertainment Space UI showing a single Entity within a single partner's Recommendation Cluster.
- The**Continuation**cluster shows unfinished videos and relevant newly released episodes from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast a maximum of 10 entities in the Continuation cluster. Research has shown that personalized recommendations along with personalized Continuation content creates the best user engagement.

- The**Featured**cluster showcases a selection of entities from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping. There will be a single Featured cluster, which is surfaced near the top of the UI with a priority placement above all Recommendation clusters. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast up to 10 entities in the Featured cluster.

### Pre-work

Minimum API level: 19

Add the`com.google.android.engage:engage-core`library to your app:  

    dependencies {
        // Make sure you also include that repository in your project's build.gradle file.
        implementation 'com.google.android.engage:engage-core:1.5.11'
    }

For more information, see[Package visibility in Android 11](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/package-visibility).

### Summary

The design is based on an implementation of a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

The data a client can publish is subject to the following limits for different cluster types:

|       Cluster type        | Cluster limits | Maximum entity limits in a cluster |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Recommendation Cluster(s) | At most 7      | At most 50                         |
| Continuation Cluster      | At most 1      | At most 20                         |
| Featured Cluster          | At most 1      | At most 20                         |

### Step 0: Migration from existing Media Home SDK integration

#### Map data models from existing integration

If you are migrating from an existing Media Home integration, the following table outlines how to map data models in existing SDKs to the new Engage SDK:

|         MediaHomeVideoContract integration equivalent         |                                                                      Engage SDK integration equivalent                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.PreviewChannel`           | ` com.google.android.engage.common.datamodel.RecommendationCluster `                                                                                                        |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.PreviewChannel.Builder`   | ` com.google.android.engage.common.datamodel.RecommendationCluster.Builder `                                                                                                |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.PreviewChannelHelper`     | `com.google.android.engage.video.service.AppEngageVideoClient`                                                                                                              |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.PreviewProgram`           | Divided into separate classes:`EventVideo`,`LiveStreamingVideo`,`Movie`,`TvEpisode`,`TvSeason`,`TvShow`,`VideoClipEntity`                                                   |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.PreviewProgram.Builder`   | Divided into builders in separate classes:`EventVideo`,`LiveStreamingVideo`,`Movie`,`TvEpisode`,`TvSeason`,`TvShow`,`VideoClipEntity`                                       |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.VideoContract`            | No longer needed.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.WatchNextProgram`         | Divided into attributes in separate classes:`EventVideoEntity`,`LiveStreamingVideoEntity`,`MovieEntity`,`TvEpisodeEntity`,`TvSeasonEntity`,`TvShowEntity`,`VideoClipEntity` |
| `com.google.android.mediahome.video.WatchNextProgram.Builder` | Divided into attributes in separate classes:`EventVideoEntity`,`LiveStreamingVideoEntity`,`MovieEntity`,`TvEpisodeEntity`,`TvSeasonEntity`,`TvShowEntity`,`VideoClipEntity` |

#### Publishing clusters in Media Home SDK vs Engage SDK

With Media Home SDK, clusters and entities were published through separate APIs:  

    // 1. Fetch existing channels
    List<PreviewChannel> channels = PreviewChannelHelper.getAllChannels();

    // 2. If there are no channels, publish new channels
    long channelId = PreviewChannelHelper.publishChannel(builder.build());

    // 3. If there are existing channels, decide whether to update channel contents
    PreviewChannelHelper.updatePreviewChannel(channelId, builder.build());

    // 4. Delete all programs in the channel
    PreviewChannelHelper.deleteAllPreviewProgramsByChannelId(channelId);

    // 5. publish new programs in the channel
    PreviewChannelHelper.publishPreviewProgram(builder.build());

With Engage SDK, cluster and entity publishing are combined into a single API call. All entities that belong to a cluster are published together with that cluster:  

### Kotlin

    RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                .addEntity(MOVIE_ENTITY)
                .addEntity(MOVIE_ENTITY)
                .addEntity(MOVIE_ENTITY)
                .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                .build()

### Java

    new RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                            .addEntity(MOVIE_ENTITY)
                            .addEntity(MOVIE_ENTITY)
                            .addEntity(MOVIE_ENTITY)
                            .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                            .build();

### Step 1: Provide entity data

The SDK has defined different entities to represent each item type. We support the following entities for the Watch category:

1. [`MovieEntity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#movieentity)
2. [`TvShowEntity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#tvshowentity)
3. [`TvSeasonEntity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#tvseasonentity)
4. [`TvEpisodeEntity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#tvepisodeentity)
5. [`LiveStreamingVideoEntity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#livestreamingvideoentity)
6. [`VideoClipEntity`](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch#videoclipentity)

The following chart outlines attributes and requirements for each type.

#### `MovieEntity`

|          Attribute          |      Requirement       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Watch next type             | Conditionally required | Must be provided when the item is in the Continuation cluster and must be one of the following four types: CONTINUE: The user has already watched more than 1 minute of this content. NEW: The user has watched all available episodes from some episodic content, but a new episode has become available and there is exactly one unwatched episode. This works for TV shows, recorded soccer matches in a series, and so on. NEXT: The user has watched one or more complete episodes from some episodic content, but there remains either more than one episode remaining or exactly one episode remaining where the last episode is not "NEW" and was released before the user started watching the episodic content. WATCHLIST: The user has explicitly elected to add a movie, event, or series to a watchlist to manually curate what they want to watch next. |

| Watch next type             | Conditionally required | Must be provided when the item is in the Continuation cluster and must be one of the following four types: CONTINUE: The user has already watched more than 1 minute of this content. NEW: The user has watched all available episodes from some episodic content, but a new episode has become available and there is exactly one unwatched episode. This works for TV shows, recorded soccer matches in a series, and so on. NEXT: The user has watched one or more complete episodes from some episodic content, but there remains either more than one episode remaining or exactly one episode remaining where the last episode is not "NEW" and was released before the user started watching the episodic content. WATCHLIST: The user has explicitly elected to add a movie, event, or series to a watchlist to manually curate what they want to watch next. |

| Watch next type             | Conditionally required               | Must be provided when the item is in the Continuation cluster and must be one of the following four types: CONTINUE: The user has already watched more than 1 minute of this content. NEW: The user has watched all available episodes from some episodic content, but a new episode has become available and there is exactly one unwatched episode. This works for TV shows, recorded soccer matches in a series, and so on. NEXT: The user has watched one or more complete episodes from some episodic content, but there remains either more than one episode remaining or exactly one episode remaining where the last episode is not "NEW" and was released before the user started watching the episodic content. WATCHLIST: The user has explicitly elected to add a movie, event, or series to a watchlist to manually curate what they want to watch next. |

| Watch next type             | Conditionally required | Must be provided when the item is in the Continuation cluster and must be one of the following four types: CONTINUE: The user has already watched more than 1 minute of this content. NEW: The user has watched all available episodes from some episodic content, but a new episode has become available and there is exactly one unwatched episode. This works for TV shows, recorded soccer matches in a series, and so on. NEXT: The user has watched one or more complete episodes from some episodic content, but there remains either more than one episode remaining or exactly one episode remaining where the last episode is not "NEW" and was released before the user started watching the episodic content. WATCHLIST: The user has explicitly elected to add a movie, event, or series to a watchlist to manually curate what they want to watch next. |

NEW: The user has watched all available episodes from some episodic content, but a new episode has become available and there is exactly one unwatched episode. This works for TV shows, recorded soccer matches in a series, and so on. NEXT: The user has watched one or more complete episodes from some episodic content, but there remains either more than one episode remaining or exactly one episode remaining where the last episode is not "NEW" and was released before the user started watching the episodic content.

#### Example

### Kotlin

    var movie = MovieEntity.Builder()
        .setName("Avengers")
        .addPosterImage(Image.Builder()
                              .setImageUri(Uri.parse("http://www.x.com/image.png"))
                              .setImageHeightInPixel(960)
                              .setImageWidthInPixel(408)
                              .build())
        .setPlayBackUri(Uri.parse("http://tv.com/playback/1"))
        .setReleaseDateEpochMillis(1633032895L)
        .setAvailability(ContentAvailability.AVAILABILITY_AVAILABLE)
        .setDurationMillis(12345678L)
        .addGenre("action")
        .addContentRating("R")
        .setWatchNextType(WatchNextType.TYPE_NEW)
        .setLastEngagementTimeMillis(1664568895L)
        .build()

### Java

    MovieEntity movie = new MovieEntity.Builder()
                      .setName("Avengers")
                      .addPosterImage(
                          new Image.Builder()
                              .setImageUri(Uri.parse("http://www.x.com/image.png"))
                              .setImageHeightInPixel(960)
                              .setImageWidthInPixel(408)
                              .build())
                      .setPlayBackUri(Uri.parse("http://tv.com/playback/1"))
                      .setReleaseDateEpochMillis(1633032895L)
                      .setAvailability(ContentAvailability.AVAILABILITY_AVAILABLE)
                      .setDurationMillis(12345678L)
                      .addGenre("action")
                      .addContentRating("R")
                      .setWatchNextType(WatchNextType.TYPE_NEW)
                      .setLastEngagementTimeMillis(1664568895L)
                      .build();

### Step 2: Provide Cluster data

It's recommended to have the content publish job executed in the background (for example, using[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)) and scheduled on a regular basis or on an event basis (for example, every time the user opens the app or when the user just added something to their cart).

`AppEngagePublishClient`is responsible for publishing clusters. Following APIs are available in the client:

- `isServiceAvailable`
- `publishRecommendationClusters`
- `publishFeaturedCluster`
- `publishContinuationCluster`
- `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`
- `updatePublishStatus`
- `deleteRecommendationsClusters`
- `deleteFeaturedCluster`
- `deleteContinuationCluster`
- `deleteUserManagementCluster`
- `deleteClusters`

#### `isServiceAvailable`

This API is used to check if the service is available for integration and whether the content can be presented on the device.  

### Kotlin

    client.isServiceAvailable.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Handle IPC call success
            if(task.result) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    }

### Java

    client.isServiceAvailable().addOnCompleteListener(task - > {
        if (task.isSuccessful()) {

          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    });

| **Note:** We highly recommend keeping a periodic job running to check if the service becomes available at a later point in time. The availability of the service may change with Android version upgrades, app upgrades, installs, and uninstalls. By ensuring periodic job checks at a certain time interval, data can be published once the service becomes available.

#### `publishRecommendationClusters`

This API is used to publish a list of`RecommendationCluster`objects.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
          PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
            .addRecommendationCluster(
              RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                .addEntity(entity1)
                .addEntity(entity2)
                .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                .build()
            )
            .build()
        )

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addRecommendationCluster(
                        new RecommendationCluster.Builder()

                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`RecommendationCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Recommendation Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishFeaturedCluster`

This API is used to publish a list of`FeaturedCluster`objects.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishFeaturedCluster(
        PublishFeaturedClusterRequest.Builder()
          .setFeaturedCluster(
            FeaturedCluster.Builder()
              .addEntity(entity1)
              .addEntity(entity2)
              .build())

                            .addEntity(entity2)
                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`FeaturedCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Featured Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishContinuationCluster`

This API is used to publish a`ContinuationCluster`object.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishContinuationCluster(
        PublishContinuationClusterRequest.Builder()
          .setContinuationCluster(
            ContinuationCluster.Builder()
              .addEntity(entity1)
              .addEntity(entity2)
              .build())

                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`UserAccountManagementCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated UserAccountManagementCluster Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `updatePublishStatus`

If for any internal business reason, none of the clusters is published, we**strongly recommend** updating the publish status using the**updatePublishStatus**API. This is important because :

- Providing the status in all scenarios, even when the content is published (STATUS == PUBLISHED), is critical to populate dashboards that use this explicit status to convey the health and other metrics of your integration.
- If no content is published but the integration status isn't broken (STATUS == NOT_PUBLISHED), Google can avoid triggering alerts in the app health dashboards. It confirms that content is not published due to an**expected**situation from the provider's standpoint.
- It helps developers provide insights into when the data is published versus not.
- Google may use the status codes to nudge the user to do certain actions in the app so they can see the app content or overcome it.

The list of eligible publish status codes are :  

    // Content is published
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.PUBLISHED,

    // Content is not published as user is not signed in
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN,

    // Content is not published as user is not subscribed
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SUBSCRIPTION,

    // Content is not published as user location is ineligible
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_INELIGIBLE_LOCATION,

    // Content is not published as there is no eligible content
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_NO_ELIGIBLE_CONTENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature is disabled by the client
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_CLIENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a client error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_CLIENT_ERROR,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a service error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_SERVICE_ERROR,

    // Content is not published due to some other reason
    // Reach out to engage-developers@ before using this enum.
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_OTHER

If the content is not published due to a user not logged in, Google would recommend publishing the Sign In Card. If for any reason providers are not able to publish the Sign In Card then we recommend calling the**updatePublishStatus** API with the status code**NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN**  

### Kotlin

    client.updatePublishStatus(
       PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
         .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
         .build())

### Java

    client.updatePublishStatus(
        new PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
            .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
            .build());

                    .build());

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from all clusters matching the specified cluster types. Clients can choose to pass one or many cluster types. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### Error handling

It is highly recommended to listen to the task result from the publish APIs such that a follow-up action can be taken to recover and resubmit an successful task.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
            PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
              .addRecommendationCluster(..)
              .build())
          .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
            if (task.isSuccessful) {
              // do something
            } else {
              val exception = task.exception
              if (exception is AppEngageException) {
                @AppEngageErrorCode val errorCode = exception.errorCode
                if (errorCode == AppEngageErrorCode.SERVICE_NOT_FOUND) {
                  // do something
                }
              }
            }
          }

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                  new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                      .addRecommendationCluster(...)
                      .build())
              .addOnCompleteListener(
                  task -> {
                    if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                      // do something
                    } else {
                      Exception exception = task.getException();
                      if (exception instanceof AppEngageException) {
                        @AppEngageErrorCode
                        int errorCode = ((AppEngageException) exception).getErrorCode();
                        if (errorCode == AppEngageErrorCode.SERVICE_NOT_FOUND) {
                          // do something
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  });

The error is returned as an`AppEngageException`with the cause included as an error code.

| Error code |            Error name             |                                                                  Note                                                                   |

| `2`        | `SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE`           | The service is available on the given device, but it is not available at the time of the call (for example, it is explicitly disabled). |
| `3`        | `SERVICE_CALL_EXECUTION_FAILURE`  | The task execution failed due to threading issues. In this case, it can be retried.                                                     |
| `4`        | `SERVICE_CALL_PERMISSION_DENIED`  | The caller is not allowed to make the service call.                                                                                     |
| `5`        | `SERVICE_CALL_INVALID_ARGUMENT`   | The request contains invalid data (for example, more than the allowed number of clusters).                                              |
| `6`        | `SERVICE_CALL_INTERNAL`           | There is an error on the service side.                                                                                                  |
| `7`        | `SERVICE_CALL_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | The service call is made too frequently.                                                                                                |

### Step 3: Handle broadcast intents

In addition to making publish content API calls through a job, it is also required to set up a[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)to receive the request for a content publish.

The goal of broadcast intents is mainly for app reactivation and forcing data sync. Broadcast intents are not designed to be sent very frequently. It is only triggered when the Engage Service determines the content might be stale (for example, a week old). That way, there is more confidence that the user can have a fresh content experience, even if the application has not been executed for a long period of time.

The`BroadcastReceiver`must be set up in the following two ways:

- Dynamically register an instance of the`BroadcastReceiver`class using`Context.registerReceiver()`. This enables communication from applications that are still live in memory.

### Kotlin

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver(){
      // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
      // is received
      // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received
      // Trigger continuation cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUATION broadcast is
      // received
    }

    fun registerBroadcastReceivers(context: Context){
      var  context = context
      context = context.applicationContext

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Continuation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),

### Java

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents. ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,

    }

- Statically declare an implementation with the`<receiver>`tag in your`AndroidManifest.xml`file. This allows the application to receive broadcast intents when it is not running, and also allows the application to publish the content.

    <application>
       <receiver
          android:name=".AppEngageBroadcastReceiver"
          android:permission="com.google.android.engage.REQUEST_ENGAGE_DATA"
          android:exported="true"
          android:enabled="true">
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_CONTINUATION" />
          </intent-filter>
       </receiver>
    </application>

The following[intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)is sent by the service:

- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION`It is recommended to start a`publishRecommendationClusters`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED`It is recommended to start a`publishFeaturedCluster`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_CONTINUATION`It is recommended to start a`publishContinuationCluster`call when receiving this intent.
