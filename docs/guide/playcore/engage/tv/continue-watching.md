Continue Watching leverages the **Continuation cluster** to show unfinished
videos, and next episodes to be watched from the same TV show, from multiple
apps in one UI grouping. You can feature your entities in this continuation
cluster. Follow this guide to learn how to enhance user engagement through the
Continue Watching experience using [Engage SDK](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage).

You manage the continuation cluster by using the client API in a TV app or from
a REST API:

- [Integrate Continue Watching using REST API](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/tv/continue-watching-rest)

## Sample code

This [sample app](https://github.com/googlesamples/tv-video-discovery-samples) demonstrates how you can integrate with the video
discovery APIs to send personalized user data to Google, build a common module
that you can import in both the mobile and TV apps, when to call the publish
and delete APIs, and how to use Workers to make these calls.
