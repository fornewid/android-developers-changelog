Boost app engagement by reaching your users where they are. Integrate Engage SDK to deliver personalized recommendations and continuation content directly to users across multiple on-device surfaces, like**[Collections](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/07/introducing-collections-powered-by-engage-sdk.html)** ,**[Entertainment Space](https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space/)** , and the Play Store. The integration adds less than 50 KB (compressed) to the average APK and takes most apps about a week of developer time. Learn more at our**[business site](http://play.google.com/console/about/programs/EngageSDK)**.

This document contains instructions for developer partners to integrate new content like reservations, events, lodging, places of interest, people and other content that might not belong to any of these categories.

## Integration detail

### Terminology

This integration includes the following three cluster types:**Recommendation** ,**Featured** , and**Continuation**.

- **Recommendation**clusters show personalized suggestions from an individual developer partner. It is a UI view that contains a group of recommendations from the same developer partner.

  - **ArticleEntity**: ArticleEntity that represents a text-based recommendation for content that is relevant to more than one category of content. ArticleEntity item allows developers to provide a variety of text and image content with more metadata to articulate the information to the users compared to GenericFeaturedEntity. Ex: Marketing content, News snippet

  - **EventEntity**: EventEntity represents an event happening in the future. Event start time is a critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users.

  - **LodgingEntity**: LodgingEntity represents an accommodation, such as a hotel, apartment, vacation home for short term and long term rental.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/lodging-entity-travel.png)**Figure 3:**UI showing a single LodgingEntity within Recommendations cluster.
  - **StoreEntity**: StoreEntity represents a store, restaurant, cafe etc. It highlights content where a dining venue or store is the critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/store-entity-travel.png)**Figure 4:**UI showing a single StoreEntity within Recommendations cluster.
  - **PointOfInterestEntity**: PointOfInterestEntity represents a place of interest like, a gas station, event venue, theme park, museum, tourist attraction, hiking trail etc. It highlights content where location is a critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users. It shouldn't be used for lodging, a store or a dining venue.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/poi-entity-travel.png)**Figure 5:**UI showing a single PointOfInterestEntity within Recommendations cluster.
  - **PersonEntity**: PersonEntity represents a person. The recommendations could be to highlight a person in categories like health and fitness, sports, dating, etc.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/person-entity-dating.png)**Figure 5:**UI showing a single PersonEntity within Recommendations cluster.
- The**Continuation**cluster shows content recently engaged by users from multiple developer partners in a single UI grouping. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast a maximum of 10 entities in the Continuation cluster.

  Your continuation content can take the following structure:
  - **ArticleEntity**: ArticleEntity that represents a text-based recommendation for content that is relevant to more than one category of content. This entity can be used to represent unfinished news articles or other content that the user would like to continue consuming from where they left it. Ex: Marketing content, News snippet

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/article-entity-continuation-travel.png)**Figure 6.**UI showing a single ArticleEntity within a Continuation cluster.
  - **RestaurantReservationEntity**: RestaurantReservationEntity represents a reservation for a restaurant or cafe and helps users track upcoming or ongoing restaurant reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/restaurant-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 7.**UI showing a single RestaurantReservationEntity within a Continuation cluster.
  - **EventReservationEntity**: EventReservationEntity represents a reservation for an event and helps users track upcoming or ongoing events reservations. Events could include, but not limited to the following:

    - Sports events like reservation for a football match
    - Gaming events like reservation for eSports
    - Entertainment events like reservation for movies in a cinema, concert, theater, book signing
    - Travel or point of interest reservations like guided tours, museum tickets
    - Social / Seminar / Conferences reservations
    - Education / Training sessions reservations

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/event-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 8.**UI showing a single EventReservationEntity within a Continuation cluster.
  - **LodgingReservationEntity**: LodgingEntityReservation represents a reservation for a travel lodging and helps users track upcoming or ongoing hotel or vacation rental reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/lodging-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 9.**UI showing a single LodgingReservationEntity within a Continuation cluster.
  - **TransportationReservationEntity**: TransportationReservationEntity represents a reservation for transportation by any mode and helps users track reservations for upcoming or ongoing flight, ferry, train, bus, ride-hailing, or cruise.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/transportation-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 10.**UI showing a single TransportationReservationEntity within a Continuation cluster.
  - **VehicleRentalReservationEntity**: VehicleRentalReservationEntity represents a vehicle rental reservation and helps users track upcoming or ongoing vehicle rental reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/vehicle-rental-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 11.**UI showing a single VehicleRentalReservationEntity within a Continuation cluster.
- The**Featured** cluster is a UI view that showcases the chosen hero`GenericFeaturedEntity`from many developer partners in one UI grouping. There is a single Featured cluster, which is surfaced near the top of the UI, with a priority placement above all Recommendation clusters. Each developer partner is allowed to broadcast a single entity of a supported type in Featured, with many entities (potentially of different types) from multiple app developers in the Featured cluster.

  - **GenericFeaturedEntity**: GenericFeaturedEntity differs from Recommendation item in that Featured item should be used for a single top content from developers and should represent the single most important content that will be interesting and relevant to users.

### Pre-work

Minimum API level: 19

Add the`com.google.android.engage:engage-core`library to your app:  

    dependencies {
        // Make sure you also include that repository in your project's build.gradle file.
        implementation 'com.google.android.engage:engage-core:1.5.11'
    }

### Summary

The design is based on an implementation of a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

The data a client can publish is subject to the following limits for different cluster types:

|       Cluster type        | Cluster limits | Minimum entity limits in a cluster |                                                           Maximum entity limits in a cluster                                                           |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommendation Cluster(s) | At most 7      | At least 1                         | At most 50 (`ArticleEntity`,`EventEntity`,`LodgingEntity`,`StoreEntity`,`PointOfInterestEntity`, or`PersonEntity`)                                     |
| Continuation Cluster      | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 20 (`ArticleEntity`,`EventReservationEntity`,`LodgingReservationEntity`,`TransportationReservationEntity`, or`VehicleRentalReservationEntity`) |
| Featured Cluster          | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 20 (`GenericFeaturedEntity`)                                                                                                                   |

### Step 1: Provide entity data

The SDK has defined different entities to represent each item type. We support the following entities for the others category:

1. `GenericFeaturedEntity`
2. `ArticleEntity`
3. `EventEntity`
4. `LodgingEntity`
5. `StoreEntity`
6. `PointOfInterestEntity`
7. `PersonEntity`
8. `RestaurantReservationEntity`
9. `EventReservationEntity`
10. `LodgingReservationEntity`
11. `TransportationReservationEntity`
12. `VehicleRentalReservationEntity`

The charts below outline available attributes and requirements for each type.

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*File formats*

PNG, JPG, static GIF, WebP

*Maximum file size*

5120 KB

*Additional recommendations*

- **Image safe area:**Put your important content in the center 80% of the image.
- Use a transparent background so that the image can be properly displayed in Dark and Light theme settings.

#### Content Category

The content category allows apps to publish content belonging to multiple categories. This maps the content with some of the predefined categories namely:

- `TYPE_EDUCATION`
- `TYPE_SPORTS`
- `TYPE_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS`
- `TYPE_BOOKS`
- `TYPE_AUDIOBOOKS`
- `TYPE_MUSIC`
- `TYPE_DIGITAL_GAMES`
- `TYPE_TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL`
- `TYPE_HOME_AND_AUTO`
- `TYPE_BUSINESS`
- `TYPE_NEWS`
- `TYPE_FOOD_AND_DRINK`
- `TYPE_SHOPPING`
- `TYPE_HEALTH_AND_FITENESS`
- `TYPE_MEDICAL`
- `TYPE_PARENTING`
- `TYPE_DATING`

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*Guidelines to use the content categories*

1. Some entities like**ArticleEntity** and**GenericFeaturedEntity** are eligible to use any of the content categories. For other entities like**EventEntity** ,**EventReservationEntity** ,**PointOfInterestEntity**, only a subset of these categories are eligible. Check the list of categories eligible for an entity type before populating the list.
2. Use the specific entity type for some content categories over a combination of the Generic entities and the ContentCategory:

   - TYPE_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS - Check out the entities from[Watch integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_BOOKS - Check out the[EbookEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/read#ebookentity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_AUDIOBOOKS - Check out[AudiobookEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/read#audiobookentity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_SHOPPING - Check out[ShoppingEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/shopping#shoppingEntity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_FOOD_AND_DRINK - Check out entities from[Food Integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/food)before using the generic entities.
3. The ContentCategory field is optional and should be left blank if the content doesn't belong to any of the categories mentioned earlier.

4. In case multiple content categories are provided, provide them in the order of relevance to the content with the most relevant content category placed first in the list.

### Step 2: Provide Cluster data

It is recommended to have the content publish job executed in the background (for example, using[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)) and scheduled on a regular basis or on an event basis (for example, every time the user opens the app or when the user just added something to their cart).

`AppEngagePublishClient`is responsible for publishing clusters.

There are following APIs to publish clusters in the client:

- `isServiceAvailable`
- `publishRecommendationClusters`
- `publishFeaturedCluster`
- `publishContinuationCluster`
- `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`
- `updatePublishStatus`
- `deleteRecommendationsClusters`
- `deleteFeaturedCluster`
- `deleteContinuationCluster`
- `deleteUserManagementCluster`
- `deleteClusters`

#### `isServiceAvailable`

This API is used to check if the service is available for integration and whether the content can be presented on the device.  

### Kotlin

    client.isServiceAvailable.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Handle IPC call success
            if(task.result) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    }

### Java

    client.isServiceAvailable().addOnCompleteListener(task - > {
        if (task.isSuccessful()) {
            // Handle success
            if(task.getResult()) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    });

| **Note:** We highly recommend keeping a periodic job running to check if the service becomes available at a later point in time. The availability of the service may change with Android version upgrades, app upgrades, installs, and uninstalls. By ensuring periodic job checks at a certain time interval, data can be published once the service becomes available.

#### `publishRecommendationClusters`

This API is used to publish a list of`RecommendationCluster`objects.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
          PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
            .addRecommendationCluster(
              RecommendationCluster.Builder()
                .addEntity(entity1)
                .addEntity(entity2)
                .setTitle("Top Picks For You")
                .build()
            )
            .build()
        )

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                    .addRecommendationCluster(
                        new RecommendationCluster.Builder()

                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`RecommendationCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Recommendation Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishFeaturedCluster`

This API is used to publish a list of`FeaturedCluster`objects.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishFeaturedCluster(
        PublishFeaturedClusterRequest.Builder()
          .setFeaturedCluster(
            FeaturedCluster.Builder()
              .addEntity(entity1)
              .addEntity(entity2)
              .build())
          .build())

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishContinuationCluster`

This API is used to publish a`ContinuationCluster`object.
**Important:** The publish APIs are upsert APIs; it replaces the existing content.**Don't**call delete and publish APIs subsequently to replace the content as the publish APIs do that inherently.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishContinuationCluster(
        PublishContinuationClusterRequest.Builder()
          .setContinuationCluster(
            ContinuationCluster.Builder()
              .addEntity(entity1)
              .addEntity(entity2)

                            .build())
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`ContinuationCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated Continuation Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`

This API is used to publish a Sign In card . The signin action directs users to the app's sign in page so that the app can publish content (or provide more personalized content)

The following metadata is part of the Sign In Card -

|  Attribute  |                    Requirement                     |                                  Description                                   |

                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`UserAccountManagementCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated UserAccountManagementCluster Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `updatePublishStatus`

If for any internal business reason, none of the clusters is published, we**strongly recommend** updating the publish status using the**updatePublishStatus**API. This is important because :

- Providing the status in all scenarios, even when the content is published (STATUS == PUBLISHED), is critical to populate dashboards that use this explicit status to convey the health and other metrics of your integration.
- If no content is published but the integration status isn't broken (STATUS == NOT_PUBLISHED), Google can avoid triggering alerts in the app health dashboards. It confirms that content is not published due to an**expected**situation from the provider's standpoint.
- It helps developers provide insights into when the data is published versus not.
- Google may use the status codes to nudge the user to do certain actions in the app so they can see the app content or overcome it.

The list of eligible publish status codes are :  

    // Content is published
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.PUBLISHED,

    // Content is not published as user is not signed in
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN,

    // Content is not published as user is not subscribed
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SUBSCRIPTION,

    // Content is not published as user location is ineligible
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_INELIGIBLE_LOCATION,

    // Content is not published as there is no eligible content
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_NO_ELIGIBLE_CONTENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature is disabled by the client
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_CLIENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a client error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_CLIENT_ERROR,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a service error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_SERVICE_ERROR,

    // Content is not published due to some other reason
    // Reach out to engage-developers@ before using this enum.
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_OTHER

If the content is not published due to a user not logged in, Google would recommend publishing the Sign In Card. If for any reason providers are not able to publish the Sign In Card then we recommend calling the**updatePublishStatus** API with the status code**NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN**  

### Kotlin

    client.updatePublishStatus(
       PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
         .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
         .build())

### Java

    client.updatePublishStatus(
        new PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
            .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
            .build());

When the service receives the request, it removes the existing data from all clusters matching the specified cluster types. Clients can choose to pass one or many cluster types. In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### Error handling

It is highly recommended to listen to the task result from the publish APIs such that a follow-up action can be taken to recover and resubmit an successful task.  

### Kotlin

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
            PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
              .addRecommendationCluster(..)
              .build())
          .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
            if (task.isSuccessful) {
              // do something
            } else {
              val exception = task.exception
              if (exception is AppEngageException) {
                @AppEngageErrorCode val errorCode = exception.errorCode
                if (errorCode == AppEngageErrorCode.SERVICE_NOT_FOUND) {
                  // do something
                }
              }
            }
          }

### Java

    client.publishRecommendationClusters(
                  new PublishRecommendationClustersRequest.Builder()
                      .addRecommendationCluster(...)
                      .build())
              .addOnCompleteListener(
                  task -> {
                    if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                      // do something
                    } else {
                      Exception exception = task.getException();
                      if (exception instanceof AppEngageException) {
                        @AppEngageErrorCode
                        int errorCode = ((AppEngageException) exception).getErrorCode();
                        if (errorCode == AppEngageErrorCode.SERVICE_NOT_FOUND) {
                          // do something
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  });

The error is returned as an`AppEngageException`with the cause included as an error code.

| Error code |            Error name             |                                                                  Note                                                                   |

| `2`        | `SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE`           | The service is available on the given device, but it is not available at the time of the call (for example, it is explicitly disabled). |
| `3`        | `SERVICE_CALL_EXECUTION_FAILURE`  | The task execution failed due to threading issues. In this case, it can be retried.                                                     |
| `4`        | `SERVICE_CALL_PERMISSION_DENIED`  | The caller is not allowed to make the service call.                                                                                     |
| `5`        | `SERVICE_CALL_INVALID_ARGUMENT`   | The request contains invalid data (for example, more than the allowed number of clusters).                                              |
| `6`        | `SERVICE_CALL_INTERNAL`           | There is an error on the service side.                                                                                                  |
| `7`        | `SERVICE_CALL_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | The service call is made too frequently.                                                                                                |

### Step 3: Handle broadcast intents

In addition to making publish content API calls through a job, it is also required to set up a[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)to receive the request for a content publish.

The goal of broadcast intents is mainly for app reactivation and forcing data sync. Broadcast intents are not designed to be sent very frequently. It is only triggered when the Engage Service determines the content might be stale (for example, a week old). That way, there is more confidence that the user can have a fresh content experience, even if the application has not been executed for a long period of time.

The`BroadcastReceiver`must be set up in the following two ways:

- Dynamically register an instance of the`BroadcastReceiver`class using`Context.registerReceiver()`. This enables communication from applications that are still live in memory.

### Kotlin

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver(){
      // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
      // is received
      // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received
      // Trigger continuation cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUATION broadcast is
      // received
    }

    fun registerBroadcastReceivers(context: Context){
      var  context = context
      context = context.applicationContext

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Continuation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_CONTINUATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)
    }

### Java

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
    // is received

    // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received

    // Trigger continuation cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUATION broadcast is
    // received
    }

    public static void registerBroadcastReceivers(Context context) {

    context = context.getApplicationContext();

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Continuation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_CONTINUATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);
    }

- Statically declare an implementation with the`<receiver>`tag in your`AndroidManifest.xml`file. This allows the application to receive broadcast intents when it is not running, and also allows the application to publish the content.

    <application>
       <receiver
          android:name=".AppEngageBroadcastReceiver"
          android:permission="com.google.android.engage.REQUEST_ENGAGE_DATA"
          android:exported="true"
          android:enabled="true">
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_CONTINUATION" />
          </intent-filter>
       </receiver>
    </application>
