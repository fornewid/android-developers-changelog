Boost app engagement by reaching your users where they are. Integrate Engage SDK to deliver personalized recommendations and continuation content directly to users across multiple on-device surfaces, like**[Collections](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/07/introducing-collections-powered-by-engage-sdk.html)** ,**[Entertainment Space](https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space/)** , and the Play Store. The integration adds less than 50 KB (compressed) to the average APK and takes most apps about a week of developer time. Learn more at our**[business site](http://play.google.com/console/about/programs/EngageSDK)**.

This guide contains instructions for developer partners to deliver travel and events content to Engage content surfaces.

## Integration detail

### Terminology

This integration includes the following cluster types:**Recommendation** ,**Featured** ,**Reservation** and**Continue Search**.

- **Recommendation**clusters show personalized travel \& event suggestions from an individual developer partner. These recommendations can be personalized to the user or generalized (for example, trending items). Use these to surface articles, events, lodging, or places of interest recommendations.

  - A Recommendation cluster can be made of`ArticleEntity`,`EventEntity`,`LodgingEntity`,`PointOfInterestEntity`, or`StoreEntity`listings, but not a mix of different entity types.

  Your recommendations take the following structure:
  - **Recommendation Cluster:**A UI view that contains a group of recommendations from the same developer partner.

  - **Entity:**An object representing a single item in a cluster. This integration offers some entities that would be surfaced using the Recommendation Cluster:

    - **ArticleEntity**: ArticleEntity represents a recommendation for text-based content related to travel \& events. It can be used for articles, blogposts, marketing content, news snippets, etc.

      ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/article-entity-travel.png)**Figure 1:**UI showing a single ArticleEntity within Recommendations cluster.
    - **EventEntity**: EventEntity represents an event happening in the future. Event start time is a critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users.

      ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/event-entity-travel.png)**Figure 2:**UI showing a single EventEntity within Recommendations cluster.
    - **LodgingEntity**: LodgingEntity represents an accommodation, such as a hotel, apartment, vacation home for short term and long term rental.

      ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/lodging-entity-travel.png)**Figure 3:**UI showing a single LodgingEntity within Recommendations cluster.
    - **StoreEntity**: StoreEntity represents a store, restaurant, cafe etc. It highlights content where a dining venue or store is the critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users.

      ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/store-entity-travel.png)**Figure 4:**UI showing a single StoreEntity within Recommendations cluster.
    - **PointOfInterestEntity**: PointOfInterestEntity represents a place of interest like, a gas station, event venue, theme park, museum, tourist attraction, hiking trail etc. It highlights content where location is a critical piece of information that needs to be conveyed to the users. It shouldn't be used for lodging, a store or a dining venue.

      ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/poi-entity-travel.png)**Figure 5:**UI showing a single PointOfInterestEntity within Recommendations cluster.
- The**Reservation**cluster shows content recently engaged by users from multiple developer partners in a single UI grouping. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast a maximum of 10 entities in the Reservation cluster.

  Your reservation content can take the following structure:
  - **RestaurantReservationEntity**: RestaurantReservationEntity represents a reservation for a restaurant or cafe and helps users track upcoming or ongoing restaurant reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/restaurant-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 6.**UI showing a single RestaurantReservationEntity within a Reservation cluster.
  - **EventReservationEntity**: EventReservationEntity represents a reservation for an event and helps users track upcoming or ongoing events reservations. Events could include, but not limited to the following:

    - Sports events like reservation for a football match
    - Gaming events like reservation for eSports
    - Entertainment events like reservation for movies in a cinema, concert, theater, book signing
    - Travel or point of interest reservations like guided tours, museum tickets
    - Social / Seminar / Conferences reservations
    - Education / Training sessions reservations

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/event-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 7.**UI showing a single EventReservationEntity within a Reservation cluster.
  - **LodgingReservationEntity**: LodgingEntityReservation represents a reservation for travel lodging and helps users track upcoming or ongoing hotel or vacation rental reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/lodging-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 8.**UI showing a single LodgingReservationEntity within a Reservation cluster.
  - **TransportationReservationEntity**: TransportationReservationEntity represents reservation for transportation by any mode and helps users track reservations for upcoming or ongoing flight, ferry, train, bus, ride-hailing, or cruise.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/transportation-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 9.**UI showing a single TransportationReservationEntity within a Reservation cluster.
  - **VehicleRentalReservationEntity**: VehicleRentalReservationEntity represents vehicle rental reservation and helps users track upcoming or ongoing vehicle rental reservations.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/vehicle-rental-reservation-entity-travel.png)**Figure 10.**UI showing a single VehicleRentalReservationEntity within a Reservation cluster.
- The**Featured**cluster showcases a selection of entities from multiple developer partners in one UI grouping. There will be a single Featured cluster, which is surfaced near the top of the UI with a priority placement above all Recommendation clusters. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast up to 10 entities in the Featured cluster.

  - **GenericFeaturedEntity**: GenericFeaturedEntity differs from Recommendation item in that Featured item should be used for a single top content from developers and should represent the single most important content that will be interesting and relevant to users.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/guide/playcore/engage/featured-cluster-travel.png)**Figure 11:**UI showing a FeaturedCluster with a list of GenericFeaturedEntity
- The**Continue Search**cluster helps users resume their previous travel search journey by showcasing a list of search queries that the user has recently searched for across all their travel apps. The cluster will be pinned in second position, after reservations and before featured and recommendation clusters. Each developer partner will be allowed to broadcast up to 3 entities in the Continue Search cluster.

  - **PointOfInterestEntity:**PointOfInterestEntity represents a place of interest like, a gas station, event venue, theme park, museum, tourist attraction, hiking trail etc. It highlights content the user has previously searched for.

### Pre-work

Minimum API level: 19

Add the`com.google.android.engage:engage-core`library to your app:  

    dependencies {
        // Make sure you also include that repository in your project's build.gradle file.
        implementation 'com.google.android.engage:engage-core:1.5.11'
    }

### Summary

The design is based on an implementation of a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services).

The data a client can publish is subject to the following limits for different cluster types:

|       Cluster type        | Cluster limits | Minimum entity limits in a cluster |                                                                  Maximum entity limits in a cluster                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommendation Cluster(s) | At most 7      | At least 1                         | At most 50 (`ArticleEntity`,`EventEntity`,`LodgingEntity`,`StoreEntity`, or`PointOfInterestEntity`)                                                                  |
| Reservation Cluster       | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 20 (`RestaurantReservationEntity`,`EventReservationEntity`,`LodgingReservationEntity`,`TransportationReservationEntity`, or`VehicleRentalReservationEntity`) |
| Featured Cluster          | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 20 (`GenericFeaturedEntity`)                                                                                                                                 |
| Continue Search Cluster   | At most 1      | At least 1                         | At most 3 (`PointOfInterestEntity`)                                                                                                                                  |

### Step 1: Provide entity data

The SDK has defined different entities to represent each item type. We support the following entities for the Travel \& Events category:

1. `GenericFeaturedEntity`
2. `ArticleEntity`
3. `EventEntity`
4. `LodgingEntity`
5. `StoreEntity`
6. `PointOfInterestEntity`
7. `RestaurantReservationEntity`
8. `EventReservationEntity`
9. `LodgingReservationEntity`
10. `TransportationReservationEntity`
11. `VehicleRentalReservationEntity`

The charts below outline available attributes and requirements for each type.

#### Image specifications

Required specifications for image assets are listed in this table:

|        Aspect ratio        | Minimum pixels | Recommended pixels |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Square (1x1) **Preferred** | 300x300        | 1200x1200          |
| Landscape (1.91x1)         | 600x314        | 1200x628           |
| Portrait (4x5)             | 480x600        | 960x1200           |

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*File formats*

PNG, JPG, static GIF, WebP

*Maximum file size*

5120 KB

*Additional recommendations*

- **Image safe area:**Put your important content in the center 80% of the image.
- Use a transparent background so that the image can be properly displayed in Dark and Light theme settings.

#### Timezone specifications

Prefer ID (for example, "America/Los_Angeles") over offset (for example, "-07:00").

Sample usage:`DateTimeZone.forID("America/Los_Angeles")`

#### Content Category

The content category allows apps to publish content belonging to multiple categories. This maps the content with some of the predefined categories namely:

- `TYPE_EDUCATION`
- `TYPE_SPORTS`
- `TYPE_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS`
- `TYPE_BOOKS`
- `TYPE_AUDIOBOOKS`
- `TYPE_MUSIC`
- `TYPE_DIGITAL_GAMES`
- `TYPE_TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL`
- `TYPE_HOME_AND_AUTO`
- `TYPE_BUSINESS`
- `TYPE_NEWS`
- `TYPE_FOOD_AND_DRINK`
- `TYPE_SHOPPING`
- `TYPE_HEALTH_AND_FITENESS`
- `TYPE_MEDICAL`
- `TYPE_PARENTING`
- `TYPE_DATING`

The images are required to be hosted on public CDNs so that Google can access them.

*Guidelines to use the content categories*

1. Some entities like**ArticleEntity** and**GenericFeaturedEntity** are eligible to use any of the content categories. For other entities like**EventEntity** ,**EventReservationEntity** ,**PointOfInterestEntity**, only a subset of these categories are eligible. Check the list of categories eligible for an entity type before populating the list.
2. Use the specific entity type for some content categories over a combination of the Generic entities and the ContentCategory:

   - TYPE_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS - Check out the entities from[Watch integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/watch)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_BOOKS - Check out the[EbookEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/read#ebookentity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_AUDIOBOOKS - Check out[AudiobookEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/read#audiobookentity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_SHOPPING - Check out[ShoppingEntity](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/shopping#shoppingEntity)before using the generic entities.
   - TYPE_FOOD_AND_DRINK - Check out entities from[Food Integration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/food)before using the generic entities.
3. The ContentCategory field is optional and should be left blank if the content doesn't belong to any of the categories mentioned earlier.

4. In case multiple content categories are provided, provide them in the order of relevance to the content with the most relevant content category placed first in the list.

### Step 2: Provide Cluster data

It is recommended to have the content publish job executed in the background (for example, using[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager)) and scheduled on a regular basis or on an event basis (for example, every time the user opens the app or when the user just added something to their cart).

`AppEngageTravelClient`is responsible for publishing clusters.

There are following APIs to publish clusters in the client:

- `isServiceAvailable`
- `publishRecommendationClusters`
- `publishFeaturedCluster`
- `publishReservationCluster`
- `publishContinueSearchCluster`
- `publishUserAccountManagementRequest`
- `updatePublishStatus`
- `deleteRecommendationsClusters`
- `deleteFeaturedCluster`
- `deleteReservationCluster`
- `deleteContinueSearchCluster`
- `deleteUserManagementCluster`
- `deleteClusters`

#### `isServiceAvailable`

This API is used to check if the service is available for integration and whether the content can be presented on the device.  

### Kotlin

    client.isServiceAvailable.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Handle IPC call success
            if(task.result) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    }

### Java

    client.isServiceAvailable().addOnCompleteListener(task - > {
        if (task.isSuccessful()) {
            // Handle success
            if(task.getResult()) {
              // Service is available on the device, proceed with content publish
              // calls.
            } else {
              // Service is not available, no further action is needed.
            }
        } else {
          // The IPC call itself fails, proceed with error handling logic here,
          // such as retry.
        }
    });

| **Note:** We highly recommend keeping a periodic job running to check if the service becomes available at a later point in time. The availability of the service may change with Android version upgrades, app upgrades, installs, and uninstalls. By ensuring periodic job checks at a certain time interval, data can be published once the service becomes available.

                    .setSignInCardEntity(SIGN_IN_CARD_ENTITY)
                    .build());

When the service receives the request, the following actions take place within one transaction:

- Existing`UserAccountManagementCluster`data from the developer partner is removed.
- Data from the request is parsed and stored in the updated UserAccountManagementCluster Cluster.

In case of an error, the entire request is rejected and the existing state is maintained.

#### `updatePublishStatus`

If for any internal business reason, none of the clusters is published, we**strongly recommend** updating the publish status using the**updatePublishStatus**API. This is important because :

- Providing the status in all scenarios, even when the content is published (STATUS == PUBLISHED), is critical to populate dashboards that use this explicit status to convey the health and other metrics of your integration.
- If no content is published but the integration status isn't broken (STATUS == NOT_PUBLISHED), Google can avoid triggering alerts in the app health dashboards. It confirms that content is not published due to an**expected**situation from the provider's standpoint.
- It helps developers provide insights into when the data is published versus not.
- Google may use the status codes to nudge the user to do certain actions in the app so they can see the app content or overcome it.

The list of eligible publish status codes are :  

    // Content is published
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.PUBLISHED,

    // Content is not published as user is not signed in
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN,

    // Content is not published as user is not subscribed
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SUBSCRIPTION,

    // Content is not published as user location is ineligible
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_INELIGIBLE_LOCATION,

    // Content is not published as there is no eligible content
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_NO_ELIGIBLE_CONTENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature is disabled by the client
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_FEATURE_DISABLED_BY_CLIENT,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a client error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_CLIENT_ERROR,

    // Content is not published as the feature due to a service error
    // Available in v1.3.1
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_SERVICE_ERROR,

    // Content is not published due to some other reason
    // Reach out to engage-developers@ before using this enum.
    AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_OTHER

If the content is not published due to a user not logged in, Google would recommend publishing the Sign In Card. If for any reason providers are not able to publish the Sign In Card then we recommend calling the**updatePublishStatus** API with the status code**NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN**  

### Kotlin

    client.updatePublishStatus(
       PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
         .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
         .build())

### Java

    client.updatePublishStatus(
        new PublishStatusRequest.Builder()
            .setStatusCode(AppEngagePublishStatusCode.NOT_PUBLISHED_REQUIRES_SIGN_IN)
            .build());

### Step 3: Handle broadcast intents

In addition to making publish content API calls through a job, it is also required to set up a[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)to receive the request for a content publish.

The goal of broadcast intents is mainly for app reactivation and forcing data sync. Broadcast intents are not designed to be sent very frequently. It is only triggered when the Engage Service determines the content might be stale (for example, a week old). That way, there is more confidence that the user can have a fresh content experience, even if the application has not been executed for a long period of time.

The`BroadcastReceiver`must be set up in the following two ways:

- Dynamically register an instance of the`BroadcastReceiver`class using`Context.registerReceiver()`. This enables communication from applications that are still live in memory.

### Kotlin

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver : BroadcastReceiver(){
      // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
      // is received
      // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received
      // Trigger continue search cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUE_SEARCH
      // broadcast is received
      // Trigger reservation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RESERVATION broadcast is
      // received
    }

    fun registerBroadcastReceivers(context: Context){
      var  context = context
      context = context.applicationContext

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Continue Search Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.travel.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_CONTINUE_SEARCH),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)

    // Register Reservation Cluster Publish Intent
      context.registerReceiver(AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                               IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.travel.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RESERVATION),
                               com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                               /*scheduler=*/null)
    }

### Java

    class AppEngageBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // Trigger recommendation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION broadcast
    // is received

    // Trigger featured cluster publish when PUBLISH_FEATURED broadcast is received

    // Trigger continue search cluster publish when PUBLISH_CONTINUE_SEARCH
    // broadcast is received

    // Trigger reservation cluster publish when PUBLISH_RESERVATION broadcast is
    // received
    }

    public static void registerBroadcastReceivers(Context context) {

    context = context.getApplicationContext();

    // Register Recommendation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Featured Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_FEATURED),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Continue Search Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.travel.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_CONTINUE_SEARCH),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    // Register Reservation Cluster Publish Intent
    context.registerReceiver(new AppEngageBroadcastReceiver(),
                             new IntentFilter(com.google.android.engage.travel.service.Intents.ACTION_PUBLISH_RESERVATION),
                             com.google.android.engage.service.BroadcastReceiverPermissions.BROADCAST_REQUEST_DATA_PUBLISH_PERMISSION,
                             /*scheduler=*/null);

    }

- Statically declare an implementation with the`<receiver>`tag in your`AndroidManifest.xml`file. This allows the application to receive broadcast intents when it is not running, and also allows the application to publish the content.

    <application>
       <receiver
          android:name=".AppEngageBroadcastReceiver"
          android:permission="com.google.android.engage.REQUEST_ENGAGE_DATA"
          android:exported="true"
          android:enabled="true">
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.travel.PUBLISH_CONTINUE_SEARCH" />
          </intent-filter>
          <intent-filter>
             <action android:name="com.google.android.engage.action.travel.PUBLISH_RESERVATION" />
          </intent-filter>
       </receiver>
    </application>

The following[intents](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)is sent by the service:

- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_RECOMMENDATION`It is recommended to start a`publishRecommendationClusters`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.PUBLISH_FEATURED`It is recommended to start a`publishFeaturedCluster`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.travel.PUBLISH_CONTINUE_SEARCH`It is recommended to start a`publishContinueSearchCluster`call when receiving this intent.
- `com.google.android.engage.action.travel.PUBLISH_RESERVATION`It is recommended to start a`publishReservationCluster`call when receiving this intent.
