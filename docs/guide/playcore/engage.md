# Engage SDK

Boost app engagement by reaching your users where they are. Integrate **Engage
SDK** to deliver personalized recommendations and continuation content directly
to users across multiple on-device Google surfaces, like
[Collections](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/07/introducing-collections-powered-by-engage-sdk.html),
[Entertainment Space](https://blog.google/products/android/entertainment-space/), and the Play Store.
The integration adds less than 50 KB (compressed) to the average APK and
takes most apps about a week of developer time. Learn more at our
[business site](http://play.google.com/console/about/programs/EngageSDK).
| **Note:** This program is in developer preview. [Express interest here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/contact/Engage_SDK_Developer_Preview) and read the [developer preview page](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/engage/preview) to learn more.
