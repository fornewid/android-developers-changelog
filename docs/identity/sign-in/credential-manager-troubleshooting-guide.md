This issue is specifically seen with`GetGoogleIdOption`and not`GetSignInWithGoogleOption`. This issue is fixed in Google Play services version 24.40.XX and higher.                                                       |
| **CreateCredentialCancellationException** or**GetCredentialCancellationException** Passkey registration or retrieval was canceled by the user.                                                                 | The user has chosen not to create or use a credential.

If this occurs, check the SDK for custom exception type constants that match e.type. If no match is found, it is safe to either drop or log the exception.                                                                                                                                        |

Other reasons may also have contributed to the interruption.

| **CreateCredentialUnknownException** During save password, found password failure response from one tap 16: \[28431\] Skipping password saving since the user is likely prompted with Android Autofill.        | This error only impacts Android 13 and earlier versions when Google is the designated Autofill provider. In such cases, users will receive a save prompt from Autofill, and the password will be stored in Google Password Manager. Importantly, credentials saved using Autofill with Google are bi-directionally synced with the Credential Manager API. Therefore, this error can be safely disregarded.                                                                 |

You can map it to a WebAuthn[`DomException`](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-dependencies)for further details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This points to a potential issue with your server-side integration, specifically the[digital asset link setup](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager#add-support-dal). Double-check the accuracy of the package ID and SHA within your asset link file.                                                                                                                   |
