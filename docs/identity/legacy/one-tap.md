# Overview of One Tap sign-in on Android

**Caution:** One Tap for Android is deprecated. To ensure the continued security and usability of your app,[migrate to Credential Manager](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager). Credential Manager supports passkey, password, and federated identity authentication (such as Sign-in with Google), stronger security, and a more consistent user experience.  

You can provide seamless authentication flows to your users with Google's one tap sign-in and sign-up APIs.

With One Tap sign-up, users are prompted to create an account with a dialog that's inline with your app's content, so they're never taken out of context by a sign-up screen. With just one tap, they get a secure, token-based, passwordless account with your service, protected by their Google Account. And, of course, since there's such little sign-up friction, users are much more likely to register.

Returning users are signed in with one tap, even when they switch devices or platforms. And for returning users, One Tap sign-in works with passwords, too. If they've saved their password with Google using Android autofill, Smart Lock for Passwords, or Chrome on any platform, they can share those credentials with your app and get signed in with zero friction.
