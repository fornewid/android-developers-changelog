In a typical digital credential issuance flow using the
[OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI) specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html), an
issuer needs to know that the key within the credential to be signed is stored
in a secure location. The `android_keystore_attestation` proof type---a format for
use with OpenID4VCI---provides a hardware-signed report from the
[Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore), ensuring the key is locked in a Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE) or StrongBox and cannot be exported or cloned.

> **Note:** This document does not provide a minimum recommended set of attestation checks.

## Hardware attestation overview

When a key is generated in the Android Keystore, the system can generate an
attestation certificate. This certificate is signed by a key protected by the
device's hardware, which chains back to a Google-held Root of Trust.

The `android_keystore_attestation` proof is an array of X.509 certificate
chains. Each chain represents a single authentication key and is structured by
a leaf certificate followed by intermediate certificates.

- **Leaf certificate**: Contains the key and an Android-specific attestation extension.
- **Intermediate certificates**: Connect the leaf to the Android Root.

## Verification steps

Issuers should perform several validations on the attestation.

- Find the certificate in the chain that contains the Android attestation extension (typically the leaf certificate). This certificate contains the attestation data for the key minted by the Android Keystore.
- Verify that the `attestationChallenge` field in the extension matches the `c_nonce` provided by the protocol to prevent replay attacks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** `attestationChallenge` is an `OCTET_STRING` and is the UTF-8 encoded value of the `c_nonce` string.

- Verify the value of all assertions in the extensions that you are interested in.
- Perform a revocation check against the Android Keystore certificates.

The values in the attestation proof come from several sources:

- **Issuer:** Various values are provided by the issuer, and the most common are put in the [issuer metadata format](https://developer.android.com/identity/digital-credentials/credential-issuer/keystore-attestation#issuer-metadata-format) to allow for filtering at presentation.
- **Holder:** Values such as the package name and signature come from the holder. These are not shared through standard issuance procedures and need to be obtained independently from the holder.
- **Protocol:** Values such as the nonce with `attestationChallenge` come from the protocol.

For more complete instructions on validating the attestation data, see the
following resources:

## Attestation proof format

In a credential request, the `android_keystore_attestation` proof is included
in the following example:

    {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "An array of certificate chains. Each chain attests a single key.",
      "items": {
        "type": "array",
        "description": "An X.509 certificate chain. Each certificate is a Base64-encoded string. The first element in the chain is the leaf certificate with the extension, the last is the Android Keystore root certificate.",
        "items": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "A single X.509 certificate (Base64-NoWrap padded DER encoded)."
        },
        "minItems": 1
      },
      "minItems": 1
    }

It is then stored in the `proofs` object of a credential request.

    {
      "credential_configuration_id": "org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL",
      "proofs": {
        "android_keystore_attestation": [
          [
            "MII...", // Leaf certificate (contains Keystore extension)
            "MII...", // Intermediate certificate
            "MII..."  // Android Root certificate
          ],
          [ "MII...", "MII...", "MII..." ] // second proof
        ]
      }
    }

## Issuer metadata format

An issuer indicates the proof types it supports by including the
`android_keystore_attestation` object within the `proof_types_supported` object
for a given credential configuration.

This is an example of the `android_keystore_attestation` object for issuers:

    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "proof_signing_alg_values_supported": {
          "type": "array",
          "description": "REQUIRED. As defined in OpenID4VCI 1.0 Section 12.2.4.",
          "items": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Cryptographic algorithm identifiers used in the proof_signing_alg_values_supported Credential Issuer metadata parameter for this proof type are case sensitive strings and SHOULD be one of those defined in [IANA.JOSE]."
          },
          "minItems": 1
        },
        "key_attestations_required": {
          "type": "object",
          "description": "OPTIONAL. Specifies the minimum attestation requirements.",
          "properties": {
            "key_mint_security_level": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "OPTIONAL. Minimum accepted keyMintSecurityLevel. Values defined in https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/attestation#securitylevel-values.",
              "enum": ["Software", "TrustedEnvironment", "StrongBox"],
              "default": "TrustedEnvironment"
            },
            "user_auth_types": {
              "type": "array",
              "description": "OPTIONAL. A list of authentication types which can authorize the use of the key. If empty, no authentication is required. If multiple, any are allowed.",
              "items": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Allowed values are 'LSKF' and 'BIOMETRIC'. These values are meant to mimic the values used during the key generation process here.",
                "enum": ["LSKF", "BIOMETRIC"]
              },
              "default": []
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "required": ["proof_signing_alg_values_supported"]
    }

This is an example of the outer `proof_types_supported` object:

    {
      "credential_configurations_supported": {
        "org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL": {
          "format": "mso_mdoc",
          "doctype": "org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL",
          "cryptographic_binding_methods_supported": [
            "cose_key"
          ],
          "credential_signing_alg_values_supported": [
            -7, -9
          ],
          "proof_types_supported": {
            "android_keystore_attestation": {
              "proof_signing_alg_values_supported": [
                "ES256" // ecdsaWithSHA256
              ],
              "key_attestations_required" : {
                // OPTIONAL String - Representing the minimum accepted value for keyMintSecurityLevel values
                // defined here ("Software"|"TrustedEnvironment"|"StrongBox"). Default value: "TrustedEnvironment"
                "key_mint_security_level": "TrustedEnvironment",
                // OPTIONAL List of Strings - Representing all allowed values for userAuthType values defined here.
                // [] value will represent noAuthRequired. Default value: [].
                "user_auth_types": ["LSKF", "BIOMETRIC"]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
