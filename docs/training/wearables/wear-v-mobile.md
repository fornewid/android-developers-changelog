# Wear OS versus Mobile Development

Wear OS is based on Android and is optimized for the wrist. If you have developed for Android before, you may have used many of the same features and APIs. However, there are some differences between how you design a mobile app and how you design a Wear OS app.

We recommend that you read through the[Principles of Wear OS development](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/principles)guide to learn how to design your app.

To find out how a specific feature, API, or best practice is different in Wear OS app development compared to Android mobile development, review the following table or use the filter field to find a specific topic.  

| **Feature, API, or best practice** | **Wear OS versus Mobile** |                                                                                                                                               **Wear OS details**                                                                                                                                                |
