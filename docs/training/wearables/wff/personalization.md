# Support personalization

Once you have a basic watch face put together, letting the user customize both the appearance of the watch face and the information shown on it, helps make the watch more personal and more useful.

For personalization, use`UserConfigurations`to allow the user to tailor the appearance. For customizing the information shown, include support for Complications.

For both types of customizations, the user uses the Watch Face Editor to make changes. To enable the editor, set the watch face to be*editable*(see the packaging guidance for more information).
