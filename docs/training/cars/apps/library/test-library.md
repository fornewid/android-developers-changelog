The Android for Cars [androidx.car.app.testing](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/car/app/testing/package-summary) library, which provides
auxiliary classes that you can use to validate your app's performance in a test
environment. For example, the [`SessionController`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/car/app/testing/SessionController) lets you simulate a
connection to the host and verify that the correct [`Screen`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/car/app/Screen) and
[`Template`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/car/app/model/Template) are created and returned.
