To add the library to your app, see the Jetpack library [release page](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/car-app#declaring_dependencies).
| **Important:** When depending on alpha and beta releases of the library, take extra caution when using newly introduced or experimental APIs. Specifically, new APIs in alpha releases and APIs that are annotated as experimental can change --- and potentially break --- your app when the hosts are updated. **We strongly
| recommend that you don't refer to these categories of APIs in your production
| APKs.**
