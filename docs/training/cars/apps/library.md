Use the Android for Cars App Library, [androidx.car.app](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/car-app), to bring your
[navigation](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps/navigation), [point of interest (POI)](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps/poi), [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps/iot),
and [weather](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps/weather) apps to the car. The library provides a set of templates
designed to meet driver distraction standards and to address details such as the
variety of car screen factors and input modalities.

This guide provides an overview of the library's key features and concepts and
walks you through the process of setting up a basic app.

| **Important:** Google takes driver distraction very seriously. Your app must belong to one of the supported categories and meet specific design requirements before it can be listed on Google Play for Android Auto and Android Automotive OS. By adhering to these requirements, you can make it easier to build and test your app. For more information, see [Android app quality for cars](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/car-app-quality).

## Before you begin

1. Review the [Design for Driving](https://developers.google.com/cars/design) pages specific to the Car App Library:

   - [Navigation apps](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/app-types/navigation) and [other driving-related apps](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/app-types/other) category overviews
   - [Build apps with templates](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/apps-for-drivers/build-with-templates) overview
   - [Building blocks](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/apps-for-drivers/overview) specific to [Templates](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/apps-for-drivers/templates/overview) and [Template components](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/apps-for-drivers/components/overview)
   - [Sample flows](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/sample-flows/overview) that demonstrate common user experience (UX) patterns
   - [Templated app requirements](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/create-apps/ux-requirements/templated-apps)
2. Review the [Terms and concepts](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps/library/terms-concepts).

3. Become familiar with the [Android Auto System UI](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/android-auto/product-experience/system-ui/overview) and
   [Android Automotive OS design](https://developers.google.com/cars/design/automotive-os).

4. See the [Release Notes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/car-app).

5. See the [Code samples](https://github.com/android/car-samples/tree/main/car_app_library).
