# Sharing simple data

One of the great things about Android apps is their ability to communicate and integrate with each other. Why reinvent functionality that isn't core to your application when it already exists in another application?

This section covers some common ways you can send and receive simple data (like text, images and files) between applications using the Android Sharesheet and Intent Resolver with[Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)objects.
