Wear OS helps users stay connected, achieve their health and fitness goals, and
express their personal style.

As an Android developer, you're on familiar ground. Wear OS embraces the best
practices of [Modern Android Development](https://developer.android.com/modern-android-development), allowing you to apply your
knowledge of its core libraries, principles, and techniques. For example, when
it comes to building your user interface, we recommend [Compose for Wear OS](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/compose).
As a cornerstone of the modern toolkit, it helps you write beautiful, efficient
apps with less code.

Whether you want to start with high-level design concepts or jump straight into
building your first app, these guides will set you on the right path.
