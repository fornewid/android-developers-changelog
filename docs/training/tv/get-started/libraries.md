# AndroidX TV libraries

Most AndroidX libraries can be used with Android TV. Use[Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture), such as[`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)for managing lifecycle-aware UI data and[`Room`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)to integrate with local SQLite databases, just the same as you would for mobile.

Use Compose to build Android TV apps with modern responsive UIs. Combined with`ViewModel`, Compose lets you to share the majority of your application's logic between form factors.
