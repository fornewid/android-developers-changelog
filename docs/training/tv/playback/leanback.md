| **Warning:** The Leanback library is deprecated. Use[Jetpack Compose for Android TV OS](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/playback/compose)instead.

The deprecated Leanback UI toolkit provides classes for building user interfaces with the[androidx.leanback library](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/get-started/create#leanback). The library provides a framework of classes using views and fragments based on the deprecated Material 1 design language.

For a modern, declarative UI, use[Compose for TV](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/compose)to build your TV apps instead.
