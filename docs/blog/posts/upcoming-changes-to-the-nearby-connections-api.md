# Upcoming Changes to the Nearby Connections API

1 min read ![](https://developer.android.com/static/blog/assets/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Nearby_Connections_API_Strapi_11b1de50e2_ZGVCnW.webp) 20 Jul 2026 [![View Wei Wang's profile](https://developer.android.com/static/blog/assets/weiwa_web_6a7b6f6114_ZCJJeG.webp)](https://developer.android.com/blog/authors/wei-wang) [Wei Wang](https://developer.android.com/blog/authors/wei-wang) Engineering Manager, Android BeTo User privacy and transparency are core to the Android experience. To better align with these principles, we are updating the default behavior of the Nearby Connections API regarding how it interacts with device radios.

### **What is changing?**

Previously, the Nearby Connections API could automatically toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios ON to facilitate connections without explicit user intervention. Moving forward, the API will no longer automatically enable these radios for 1P and 3P applications.

### **What this means for developers**

If your app relies on Nearby Connections, you will need to update your implementation to account for these changes:

- **Manual Radio Management:**You must ensure that the necessary radios (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) are enabled before initiating Nearby Connections tasks.
- **User Notification:**If the required radios are disabled, your app must now inform the user and request that they enable them manually. The API will no longer programmatically turn them on for you.

### **Timing**

These changes are scheduled to take effect in late 2026. We recommend reviewing your connection workflows now to ensure a seamless transition for your users.
