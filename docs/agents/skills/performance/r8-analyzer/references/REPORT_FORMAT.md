## 1. Configuration

*(Optional section for the report, omit if no relevant findings are present.)*

- **AGP Version**: \[Current\] -\> Upgrade to 9.0.
- **Full Mode** : Not enabled. Remove `android.enableR8.fullMode=false` from `gradle.properties`.

## 2. Global Disable Rules

*(Optional section for the report, omit if no relevant findings are present.)*

- `[Rule]`: Disables R8 globally. **Action**: Remove.

If there is -dontobfuscate, -dontoptimize or -dontshrink in the codebase,
mention in this section

## 3. Optimization Summary

- **Optimization Score**: \[X\]% code is available for R8 optimizations (e.g., inlining, merging) .\[100-X\]% of codebase can't be optimized by R8.
- **Shrinking Score**: \[X\]% of code will be optimized by R8 by removing unused classes, fields and methods. \[100-X\]% of codebase contains redundant classes, fields and methods that can't be removed by R8.
- **Obfuscation Score**: \[X\]% of the codebase is available for R8 to obfuscate.

Increasing these score increases the codebase available to R8 for optimizations.

## 4. Keep Rules Evaluation

### \[Rule Text\]

- **Keeps**: \[X\] items or \[X\] % of the codebase from optimization. Classes: \[X\], Fields: \[X\], Methods: \[X\] are prevented from optimization due to this keep rule
- **Kept items**: \[Class1\], \[Class2\]
- **Action** : **Remove** (Library bundles rules) OR **Refine** (Too broad, use \[Surgical Rule\]).

## 5. Subsumed Keep Rules

*(Optional section for the report, omit if no relevant findings are present.)*

### \[Redundant Rules\]

- **Subsumed By**: \[Broader Rule\]
- **Action** : **Remove**.

## 6. Historical Analysis Summary

*(Only include this section if a previous report existed. Summarize the changes
in optimization scores here to track progress. For example:)*
The previous app had scores: Optimization (XX%), Obfuscation (XX%),
and Shrinking (XX%).
The current app has scores: Optimization (YY%), Obfuscation (YY%),
and Shrinking (YY%).
**Change**: Optimization improved by ZZ%, Obfuscation improved by ZZ%,
and Shrinking improved by ZZ%.
