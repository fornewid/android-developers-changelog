Analyzes Perfetto traces to find the root cause of performance issues in
user or system Android apps (for example, janks, app startup, memory, or
latency stalls).

Use this workflow to diagnose general Android performance issues: jank, app
startup delays, latency spikes, or thread stalls.

Follow these steps in order:

## Step 1: Identify Symptom and Target

Clarify the following with the user (ask questions, present options):

- *What is the symptom*: Do they want to investigate frame drops, jank, startup latency, ANR, app crash, system crash, or memory pressure?
- *Who is the victim:* Where did they observe the symptom? For example, "a frame drop in `com.example.sample`".
- *Baseline trace:* If multiple trace files are provided (A/B trace comparison), identify which is the baseline. You will pass both to the sub-agents in Step 3, which use the baseline trace to establish expected behavior.

> **Input Trace Required:** Confirm that the user has provided a trace file path
> or URL (for example, `.pftrace`, `.perfetto-trace`, or a Perfetto UI link). If
> none is provided, pause and ask the user to provide one before proceeding.
> **Rules:**
>
> - If the symptom is not known, pause and work with the user for clarification.
> - If the symptom is known but the victim/timestamp is unknown, proceed to Step 2 (Triage) to discover candidates.

## Step 2: System-Wide Triage

Launch a sub-agent to run triage using the following prompt template:

    Trace Path: [path of the trace with the issue]
    Goal: Identify all candidate bottlenecks for [symptom] in
    [package or entire system]
    Execution: Read
    `$SKILL_ROOT/analysis/workflows/perfetto-trace-analysis/references/triage.md`
    and follow its instructions.

From the triage output:

- If no candidates are found, ask the user for specific timestamps or symptoms.
- If multiple candidates exist, present the top 3 most severe instances to the user and confirm which one(s) to investigate. The user may select one or more.

## Step 3: Investigate Candidates in Parallel

For every confirmed candidate, launch dedicated sub-agents in parallel with this
prompt:

    Trace path: [path]
    Baseline Trace Path: [path, if provided, else "None"]
    Candidate Info: [package_name, `utid`, `upid`, render_thread_utid,
    process_name, thread_name]
    Symptom Window: [start_ts, end_ts, duration]
    Expanded Symptom Window: [expanded_start_ts to end_ts, if applicable]
    System Vitals: [payload from Step 2]
    Execution Protocol: Read
    `$SKILL_ROOT/analysis/workflows/perfetto-trace-analysis/references/per_candidate_analysis.md`
    and follow it end-to-end.

AWAIT completion of all agents before proceeding to Step 4.

## Step 4: Final Consolidation and Report

Consolidate the sub-agent findings into a final report containing:

1. **Summary and Classification:** Classify root cause (hardware, software/code, scheduling policy, system exhaustion, external dependency).
2. **Dependency Chain:** Full causal path from symptom to root cause with thread names, `UTID/UPID`s, blocking states, and timestamps.
3. **Evidence Tags:** Tag every statement with `[SQL]` (backed by trace data), `[INFERRED]` (logical deduction), or `[GAP]` (untraced or missing data).
4. **Platform Context:** Cite observed slice names, values and timestamps for explaining the platform behavior. **What's bad:** "SurfaceFlinger does X around vsync" **What's a good explanation:** "`SurfaceFlinger`'s composition slice at `ts=142.3ms` ran `4ms` after the vsync signal at `ts=138.1ms`, consistent with X".
5. **Partial Suspects:** Secondary branches or unverified paths that were
   investigated but did not reach a terminal root cause, ranked by evidence
   strength. Report partial suspects even if a terminal root cause was found.

   > If evidence is evenly split between multiple potential causes, report each
   > suspicion with its supporting data so that engineers can evaluate
   > probabilities without false certainty. Do not arbitrarily pick a winner.
6. **Recommended Next Steps:** Scan the frontmatter of workflows in
   `$SKILL_ROOT/analysis/workflows/` and recommend specialized matching
   workflows, if applicable, based on the findings.
