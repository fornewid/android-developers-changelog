- **Executing against a trace:** If a trace file path or URL is provided, verify environment prerequisites in `$SKILL_ROOT/references/perfetto/setup.md` and follow the session execution workflow and practices defined in `$SKILL_ROOT/references/perfetto/sql.md`.
- **Static query authoring or debugging:** If no trace is attached, draft, optimize, or debug the queries using the syntax, schema guidelines, and standard library best practices in `$SKILL_ROOT/references/perfetto/sql.md`.
