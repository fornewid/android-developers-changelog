Use the guidelines below to orchestrate between recording workflows after
disambiguating the user intent (for example, recording a system trace or a heap
dump). The guidelines below ensure pre-flight checks are always performed and
domain-specific profiling flags are applied accurately.

## Understand the Goal

Identify the explicit artifact and the recording goal the user wants (for
example, a system trace or a heap dump). Before proceeding, ensure you have an
answer to the following question: "User intends to record a {target artifact}".

## Workflow Discovery and Execution Planning

If the user's request involves multiple distinct recording goals (for example,
setting up a specialized environment AND recording a system trace), do not merge
them:

1. Use your file search tools (for example, `grep_search`) to recursively scan the `$SKILL_ROOT/recording/workflows/` directory for workflow entry points (markdown files defining a top-level `name:` key in their frontmatter, ignoring internal `references/` subdirectories). Find all the workflows that match the user's target artifact and goal.
2. Propose all the matched workflows as options to the user, along with simple details on why they apply. Work with the user and converge on an execution plan.
3. Continue with the user selection.

> The user may ask to execute one or more workflows - sequentially or in
> parallel, or stitch two workflows together. When this happens, perform a quick
> scan of these workflows to ensure they are compatible with each other, and
> clarify with the user before proceeding.
