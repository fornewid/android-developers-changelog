        "path": "about/versions/17/features/contact-picker.md",
        "summary": "This document introduces the Android Contact Picker, a privacy-focused and standardized interface for apps to request contact information from users. The Contact Picker, available on Android 17 (Jelly Bean) and later, provides a secure alternative to requesting the broad `READ_CONTACTS` permission. Instead of accessing the entire address book, apps specify the required data fields (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses), and the user selects which contacts to share. The document explains how to integrate the Contact Picker using `Intent.ACTION_PICK_CONTACTS` and `Intent.EXTRA_REQUESTED_DATA_FIELDS` to specify the desired contact data (using MIME types from `ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds`). It provides Kotlin and Java code examples for launching the picker in both single and multi-selection modes (using `Intent.EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE` and `Intent.EXTRA_SELECTION_LIMIT`). The document also details how to handle results, including how to query the returned `Session URI` using a `ContentResolver` to access the selected contact data, demonstrating how to process the retrieved data using a `Cursor`. It includes important considerations such as backward compatibility with the legacy `ACTION_PICK` intent, testing on older SDKs (using `EXTRA_USE_SYSTEM_CONTACTS_PICKER`), and best practices: Requesting only necessary data fields; persisting data immediately (as the session URI grants temporary access); and avoiding reliance on account data due to privacy protections.  This documentation aims to guide developers in using the Contact Picker to enhance user privacy and offer a consistent and user-friendly contact sharing experience.",

The primary purpose is to enable content creators to easily adjust settings, access color palettes, and apply effects while instantly seeing the changes. The document includes two key sections: First, the document illustrates the concept with an image of what this may look like, followed by example images of how the UI renders. Second, it highlights the 'Android AdaptiveUI Samples,' offering UI/UX templates for various app categories and providing a link to a Figma kit for exploration. It also discusses the implementation of a 'supporting pane,' which is a canonical layout element for Android that can contain supplementary content or controls to keep the primary view focused. Links to further documentation on canonical layouts and supporting panes are included. Essentially, the document introduces a design pattern for Android applications, especially those targeting large screens, to enhance the content creation workflow by providing readily accessible tools and controls alongside the main content display area, ensuring an uncluttered user experience.",

It's designed to resize, wrap, align, and distribute space among items to optimize the use of available space, making it suitable for layouts with varying item sizes and responsiveness to screen size changes. The document emphasizes that `FlexBox` is heavily influenced by the CSS Flexible Box Layout specification, sharing similar concepts like main and cross axes, main and cross sizes, and terminology such as 'grow', 'shrink', and 'basis'. The document explains when to use `FlexBox` (displaying a small number of items within a larger layout, or when wrapping items) and when not to (for large numbers of items, use lazy lists/grids or for overall screen layouts, use `Grid`). It details how to apply properties to the `FlexBox` container (e.g., direction, wrap, justifyContent, alignItems) and individual items (e.g., basis, grow, shrink, alignSelf). Finally, the document outlines the layout algorithm of `FlexBox`, detailing the steps involved in calculating child sizes, sorting items, building lines, and aligning/resizing items on both the main and cross axes. It includes links to other guides for container and item behaviors, and for getting started with `FlexBox`.",

It explains how to customize `FlexBox` behavior using a `FlexBoxConfig` block. The primary focus is on the properties within `FlexBoxConfig` that control the layout: `direction`, `alignItems`, `alignContent`, `justifyContent`, `wrap`, `rowGap`, `columnGap`, and `gap`.  The `direction` property sets the main axis (either `Row` or `Column`, with reverse variants), determining the primary direction items are laid out.  `justifyContent` is used to align and distribute items along the main axis, offering options like `Start`, `Center`, `End`, `SpaceBetween`, `SpaceAround`, and `SpaceEvenly`.  `alignItems` controls alignment along the cross axis within a single line, providing options like `Start`, `End`, `Center`, `Stretch`, and `Baseline`.  `alignContent` manages the alignment and spacing of multiple lines (when wrapping is enabled), offering similar options to `justifyContent`.  The `wrap` property enables multi-line layouts; options include `NoWrap`, `Wrap`, and `WrapReverse`.  Finally, the document covers adding gaps between items using `rowGap`, `columnGap`, or the combined `gap` function. The documentation uses visual aids to illustrate the effects of different configuration options, including images showcasing the impact of each property on the item arrangement within the `FlexBox` container.

It begins by outlining the necessary steps for setting up the project, which includes adding the `androidx.compose.foundation.layout` library to the project's `lib.versions.toml` and then adding the library dependency to the app's `build.gradle.kts` file. The document then presents two examples to illustrate how `FlexBox` can be used to create layouts. The first example demonstrates a simple `FlexBox` layout with two `Text` elements stacked vertically and center-aligned. The second example showcases a more complex layout, where `FlexBox` wraps five items onto two rows, allowing them to grow unequally to fill the available space with a specified gap between items. Images are included to visualize the resulting layouts. The document concludes by directing readers to further documentation for in-depth information on `FlexBox` behavior, specifically referencing resources on \"Set container behavior\" and \"Set item behavior.\"",

It details the use of the `Modifier.flex` modifier to manipulate item size, alignment, and order. The core concepts revolve around three main aspects:\n\n1.  **Item Size:** This section covers how to manage the size of items using `basis`, `grow`, and `shrink` properties.  `basis` defines the initial or preferred size.  Different value types such as `Auto`, fixed `dp`, and percentage are explained, including behavior and example code.  `grow` determines how much an item expands to fill extra space, with examples of how different grow values affect the layout.  `shrink` addresses how items contract when space is insufficient, also detailing its behavior and examples.\n2.  **Item Alignment:** This explains how to use `alignSelf` to override the `alignItems` property of the parent `FlexBox` container for specific items. The document describes the possible values for `alignSelf` (including `Auto`) and provides example code, along with a visual representation of the effect of alignment.\n3.  **Item Order:** This part describes how to change the visual order of items within the `FlexBox` layout using the `order` property.  It explains that items are laid out in the order they are declared by default and how `order` can be used to reorder them without changing the code's declaration order. Example code shows how items with different order values are displayed, illustrating the impact of `order` on the visual layout.\n\nThe document provides code snippets, diagrams, and descriptions to clarify the usage and effect of each property, providing a comprehensive guide to controlling item behavior within a `FlexBox` layout.",
