 | **Primary use case** | Building hybrid apps with web as primary or supporting content, displaying ads, in-app campaigns, or terms of service pages. | Displaying content from external websites (like news articles or product pages). |
 | **UI control** | **Full.** It is a `View` component you can place anywhere. You control all the surrounding UI. | **Limited.** You can theme the toolbar color and add a few custom actions. |
 | **Data and sessions** | **Sandboxed.** It doesn't share cookies or logins with the user's main browser. | **Shared.** It uses the user's default browser session, including cookies and saved passwords. |

Instead, use an [Android Intent](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters) to link out of your app to the user's default browser. Doing so launches the browser and takes the user to the website in the user's default browser app. However, keep in mind that this approach takes users out of your app.
