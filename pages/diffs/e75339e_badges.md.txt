 ## Disable badging
 
 There are cases where badges don't make sense for your notifications, so you
 can disable them on a per-channel basis by calling
-[`setShowBadge(false)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel#setShowBadge(boolean))
-on your [`NotificationChannel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)
+[`setShowBadge(false)`](/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel#setShowBadge(boolean))
+on your [`NotificationChannel`](/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)
 object.
 
 For example, you might want to disable notification badges in the following
 situations:
 
-- Ongoing notifications: most ongoing notifications, such as image processing, media playback controls, or current navigation instructions, don't make sense as a badge.
-- Calendar reminders: avoid badging events occurring at the current time.
-- Clock or alarm events: avoid badging notifications related to current alarms.
