 ## How to use the AGP Upgrade Assistant
 
-To use the Upgrade Assistant, make sure your project structure accommodates the tool, and then run it from Android Studio, as described in[Run the Upgrade Assistant](https://developer.android.com/build/agp-upgrade-assistant#run-upgrade-assistant).

 ### Set up your project
 
-Before you run the Upgrade Assistant, make sure your project is properly formatted and backed up. To ensure the AGP Upgrade Assistant is set up correctly, read the following sections.

 #### Structure your project using the Gradle build files and domain-specific language
 
 To get the best use out of the AGP Upgrade Assistant, do the following:
 
-- **Configure the build using the Gradle build files** : The Upgrade Assistant relies on static analysis of the Gradle build files. To get the most out of the Upgrade Assistant, configure your build using these build files. Use[Gradle Version Catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html)to refer to dependencies and plugins defined in a`libs.versions.toml`file in the`gradle`subdirectory of your project.

-| **Note:** The Upgrade Assistant does not support projects that refer to constants or variables defined in the`buildSrc`directory, projects that use Gradle Version Catalogs defined in settings files, or projects that refer to Gradle Version Catalogs for things other than dependencies and plugins. In general, we don't recommended using`buildSrc`to structure your project, because it can be inefficient. Any change to`buildSrc`constants and variables, no matter how minor, triggers a full rebuild of the project.

Any change to `buildSrc` constants and variables, no matter how minor, triggers a full rebuild of the project.
 
 - **Use the declarative build domain-specific language**: Gradle build files are expressed in Groovy or Kotlin. However, the more declarative the expression of the project configuration, the more likely that the Upgrade Assistant successfully finds all the places that need adjustment for an upgrade.
 
-Even if a project conforms to these limitations, the Upgrade Assistant might still fail to perform a clean upgrade. See[Troubleshoot errors](https://developer.android.com/build/agp-upgrade-assistant#troubleshoot-errors)for guidance on how to resolve or report bugs.

 #### Back up your project
 
-Before you use the Upgrade Assistant, we recommend that your project has no uncommitted changes, as seen by your version control system. If you're not using version control, use a backup of a last known good version at this point.

 ### Run the Upgrade Assistant
 
 To run the Upgrade Assistant, follow these steps:
 
-1. To launch the Upgrade Assistant, navigate to**Tools \> AGP Upgrade Assistant**or click on the notification prompt, as shown in figure 1.

 2. Check the required and recommended steps.
 
-   In the left-hand panel, the tree with checkboxes details individual steps in the upgrade, categorized by whether they are required or recommended to update and whether they are prerequisites of other steps. Select individual items in the tree to display more details about each step in the main panel.
-3. To run the upgrade, select the required and desired steps and click**Run selected steps**.
-
-   The Upgrade Assistant changes the project build files and attempts to sync the new project build with Android Studio. This may take a while if you have numerous modules, as new versions of plugins and libraries may need to be downloaded.
-4. Review the post-upgrade report. This report describes the steps that were completed and if the upgrade was successful or unsuccessful. It also includes an action to revert changes that were made by the upgrade assistant if there are issues building or testing the project after the upgrade.
-
-5. Once the project has successfully synced with Android Studio, build the project and run test suites to verify that the upgrade operation has not changed any functionality.
-
-6. Once you have verified that your project is in a good state, commit the new version of your project to your version control system.

 ## Troubleshoot errors
 
-If the Upgrade Assistant suggests an upgrade but the upgrade fails, this is typically the result of making changes to the build files, resulting in a sync failure. Follow these steps to help isolate and fix the error:

-- If the error message is not clear, or it's not obvious what is causing the problem, then return the project to its original state to break the upgrade down into smaller steps. Restore the original state from version control, or from backups, and make sure the project is in its original state and synced with Android Studio.

 Investigate the error by following two kinds of upgrade breakdowns:
 
-- **Upgrade to a different version of AGP that is not the latest version.**If the upgrade that went wrong was an upgrade of a large number of versions, the best way to isolate the problem is to do a series of smaller upgrades, from version to version, to find the first upgrade that triggers the problem.
-
-- **Within an upgrade, do individual steps one at a time.**Once you determine the upgrade that triggers the problem, it might be possible to turn individual steps in the upgrade off. If it's possible, try doing each step one at a time to find which of those steps is responsible for the error. If you can't find the step responsible, check the release notes of any other Gradle plugins you are using for compatibility issues with Gradle or AGP. Sometimes, a new release addresses the use of deprecated or internal APIs.
-
-- **[Report a bug](https://developer.android.com/studio/report-bugs).** Sometimes all the preparatory steps and sync succeed but the final upgrade step still fails. In this case, please report a bug. Even if you succeed in fixing the error yourself,[report the original failure](https://developer.android.com/studio/report-bugs)to the bug tracker, so that the problem can be addressed by the development team.
