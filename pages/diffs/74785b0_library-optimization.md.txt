+final binary size and performance. Apart from the general [keep rule best
+practices](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/app-optimization/keep-rules-best-practices), library authors must adhere to specific requirements, and
+consider additional guidelines.
 
-If you must use reflection, you should only reflect into either of the
-following:
+### Adhere to optimization requirements
 
-- Specific targeted types (specific interface implementers or subclasses)
-- Code using a specific runtime annotation
+Inefficiency in libraries is a major contributor to app bloat, wasted memory,
+slow startups, and ANRs (Application Not Responding errors). Libraries must
+avoid violating the following requirements to avoid significantly reducing app
+quality, and user experience.

+  library. Broad keep rules might solve crashes in the short-term, but they

-- Don't include package-wide keep rules (such as `-keep class com.mylibrary.**

 - Don't use `-repackageclasses` in your library's consumer keep rules file. However, to optimize your library build, you can use `-repackageclasses` with an internal package name, such as `<your.library.package>.internal`, in your library's build keep rules file. This can improve your library's efficiency in unoptimized apps. However, it is generally not necessary, because apps should also be optimized.
 - Declare any attributes you need for your library to function in your library's keep rules files, even if there might be an overlap with the attributes defined in `proguard-android-optimize.txt`.

+### Common misconceptions
+
+A few common misconceptions might lead you to configure R8 incorrectly. These
+include the following:
+
+- **Incorrect understanding of R8's optimizations** : Contrary to popular
+  understanding, R8's optimizations are not limited to just obfuscation, but
+  also include code shrinking and logical optimizations with method inlining
+  and class merging techniques. For more information, see [R8 optimization
+  overview](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/app-optimization/keep-rules-best-practices).
+
+- **Bypassing optimization of obfuscated librariess** : A common error is to
+  omit a library from optimization, because the library was optimized or
+  obfuscated when it was compiled to an AAR (Android Archive) or JAR (Java
+  Archive). The optimizations during library build time are limited, and your
+  app shouldn't disable the optimization of the library by including it in a
+  keep rule. For more information, see [Optimize AAR library build](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/app-optimization/enable-app-optimization#overview).
+
+- **Incorrect understanding of the `-keep` option** The `-keep` rule prevents
+  R8 from running any of its [optimization passes](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/app-optimization/enable-app-optimization#overview). For more information,
+  see [Choose the right keep option](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/app-optimization/add-keep-rules#choose-keep).
+
+## Configure rule packaging
+
+To ensure your consumer keep rules are applied correctly, you must package them
+appropriately depending on your library format.
+
