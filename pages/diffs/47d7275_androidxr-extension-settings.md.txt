 ## Enable spacewarp
 
-[URP Application Spacewarp](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/xr-graphics-spacewarp.html)is an OpenXR optimization that helps maintain high frame rates by synthesizing every other frame. The technique uses motion vectors and depth data from previous frames to predict where pixels should move, reducing computational power and energy use.

 ## Enable vulkan subsampling
 
-Vulkan Subsampling allows images be created and sampled at variable densities using Fragment Density Maps. This Vulkan feature enables different areas of the screen to be rendered and transferred to memory at different resolutions, which is particularly useful for foveated rendering, where peripheral areas can use a lower resolution.

 ## Enable late latching
 
-[Late latching](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.oculus@4.4/api/Unity.XR.Oculus.OculusSettings.html#Unity_XR_Oculus_OculusSettings_LateLatching)is a technique that minimizes the delay between the user's physical movement and the resulting visual change on the display. It allows the head pose to be updated late in the frame generation pipeline, which improves both the comfort and perceived frame rate of your XR apps. It achieves this by reducing input latency by close to a whole frame time.
