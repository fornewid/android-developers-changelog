+### Activity embedding (split activities in the same task)
+
+Activity embedding enables apps composed of multiple activities to split activities *within the same app task* , such as for a [list‑detail](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive/canonical-layouts#list-detail) layout on large screens. Activity embedding, part of [Jetpack WindowManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/window/embedding/package-summary), lets you define configuration rules (such as split-pair rules) using XML or API calls that determine whether activities are displayed side by side or stacked. For full details, see [Activity embedding](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/activity-embedding).
