 When a foreground service reaches the six-hour limit, the service has a few
 seconds to call [`Service.stopSelf()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf()). When the system calls
 `Service.onTimeout()`, the service is no longer considered a foreground service.
 If the service does not call `Service.stopSelf()`, the system throws an internal
 exception. The exception is logged in [Logcat](https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat) with the following
-message:

     Fatal Exception: android.app.RemoteServiceException: "A foreground service of

-| **Note:** The 6-hour time limit is shared by all of an app's foreground services of the specified type. For example, if an app runs a `dataSync` service for four hours, then starts a different `dataSync` service, that second service will only be allowed to run for two hours. However, if the user brings the app to the foreground, the timer resets and the app has 6 hours available.
