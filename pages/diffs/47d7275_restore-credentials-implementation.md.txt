 Set up a [relying party server](https://developer.android.com/identity/credential-manager#authentication-terminology) similar to the server for [passkeys](https://developer.android.com/identity/passkeys).
 If you already have a [server](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/developer-guides/server-introduction) set up to handle authentication with passkeys,
 use the same server-side implementation for restore keys.
-| **Note:** While the server-side implementation is the same for passkeys and restore keys, your client-side app can support restore keys without supporting passkeys. Because restore keys work independently of the authentication method in your app (for example, passwords or Sign in with Google), you don't need to make any additional changes to the existing authentication methods in your app's code.
