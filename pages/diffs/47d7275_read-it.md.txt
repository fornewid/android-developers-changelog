-# Read It is a Google Assistant feature available on Android devices that offers another way for users to read long-form web content like news articles and blog posts. Users can say something like*"Hey Google, read it"* to have an app read web-based content out loud, highlight the words being read, and auto-scroll the page. To learn more about this feature, you can also read the[Read It product update post](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/easier-access-web-pages-let-assistant-read-it-aloud/).

 ## Provide content to Assistant
 
-For Read It to access your content, your app must provide Assistant with information about the content, like its web URI and some basic context. Assistant can then retrieve your content to be read out loud to the user.
