-# Android build structure
+Android projects contain many build-related files and directory structures to
+organize your application source and resources. Before diving into the
+configuration details, we'll take a look at the overall structure and the basics
+of what belongs in each part.
 
-Android projects contain many build-related files and directory structures to organize your application source and resources. Before diving into the configuration details, we'll take a look at the overall structure and the basics of what belongs in each part.
+This table lists typical files in an Android project. The descriptions of each
+file or directory include notes on what type of content belongs there. Best
+practices evolve over time, and these descriptions may not match a project

+build files become data declarations, which are more direct for understanding
+and editing. Future versions may include an alternative specification such as
+[Declarative Gradle](https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle), which will prevent build logic in the
+files.

+| .idea/ | **Android Studio project metadata** *Don't change files in this directory!* |
+| build.gradle(.kts) | [**Root build file**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/writing_build_scripts.html) Should only contain plugin declarations to set up a common plugin classpath across subprojects. Other code should reside in the settings or nested-project-level build files. |
+| gradle.properties | [**Gradle execution configuration**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:project_properties) Contains Gradle properties, controlling Gradle build environment aspects such as heap size, caching and parallel execution. Some temporary Android properties are defined here, to reduce changes to the AGP DSL as they're added and later removed. |
+| gradlew (linux, Mac) gradlew.bat (Windows) | [**Gradle wrapper**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) **file** Bootstraps your build by downloading a Gradle distribution and then forwarding commands to it. This lets you run builds without having to preinstall Gradle. |
+| local.properties | **Local machine configuration** Contains properties related to the local machine, such as the location of the Android SDK. *Exclude this file from source control!* |
+| settings.gradle(.kts) | [**Gradle build initialization**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/settings_file_basics.html) Contains global build information for Gradle initialization and project configuration, such as - project name - list of subprojects to include in this build - repository specifications to locate plugins and dependencies - external Version Catalog imports. |
+| gradle/ |   |
+| ↳ libs.versions.toml | [**Version Catalog**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) Defines variables for dependencies and plugins used inside your build. You specify which versions you want to use here, ensuring consistency across all subprojects in your project. |

+| app/ | [**Subproject directory**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html) Subprojects (known as "modules" in Android Studio) can build applications or libraries and may depend on other subprojects or external dependencies. `app` is the conventional name for a top-level application subproject (but is not the required name). Other subprojects have similar structures with different names. Any directory can be a subproject, and must contain at least a `build.gradle(.kts)` file, and be included in the build using `settings.gradle(.kts)`. |
+| ↳ build.gradle(.kts) | [**Subproject-level build file**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/writing_build_scripts.html) Declares how to build this subproject. Each subproject requires a separate build file, and should contain - plugins used to build this subproject - configuration blocks required by plugins - dependencies (libraries and platforms) included when building this subproject *You shouldn't include build logic (such as Kotlin function definitions or conditions) or task declarations in your build files. Build logic and tasks should only be contained inside plugins*. |
+| ↳ src/ | **Subproject source files** Groups source files (application code and resources) into [source sets](https://developer.android.com/build#sourcesets). The `main` source set contains source files that are common to all [variants](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants), while other source sets contain source files unique to a variant. |
+| ↳ main/ | **Main** [**source set**](https://developer.android.com/build#sourcesets) Source code and resources that are common across all build variants. This source acts as the base for all builds, and other, more specific source sets add to or override this source. |
