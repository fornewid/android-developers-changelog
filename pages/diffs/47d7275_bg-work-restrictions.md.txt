-# System restrictions on background tasks
+Background processes can be memory- and battery-intensive. For example, an
+implicit broadcast may start many background processes that have registered to
+listen for it, even if those processes may not do much work. This can have a
+substantial impact on both device performance and user experience.

 ## User-initiated restrictions
 
-If an app exhibits some of the bad behaviors described in[Android vitals](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals), the system prompts the user to restrict that app's access to system resources.

-If the system notices that an app is consuming excessive resources, it notifies the user, and gives the user the option of restricting the app's actions. Behaviors that can trigger the notice include:

+Behaviors that can trigger the notice include:
 
 1. **Excessive wake locks**: 1 partial wake lock held for an hour when screen is off
 2. **Excessive background services**: If app targets API levels lower than 26 and has excessive background services
 
-The precise restrictions imposed are determined by the device manufacturer. For example, on AOSP builds, restricted apps cannot run jobs, trigger alarms, or use the network, except when the app is in the foreground.

 ## Restrictions on receiving network activity broadcasts
 
-Apps don't receive[`CONNECTIVITY_ACTION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager#CONNECTIVITY_ACTION)broadcasts if they register to receive them in their manifest, and processes that depend on this broadcast won't start. This could pose a problem for apps that want to listen for network changes or perform bulk network activities when the device connects to an unmetered network. Several solutions to get around this restriction already exist in the Android framework, but choosing the right one depends on what you want your app to accomplish.
-| **Note:** A[`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver)registered with[`Context.registerReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter))continues to receive these broadcasts while the app is running.

However, the[`ConnectivityManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager)API provides a more robust method to request a callback only when specified network conditions are met.
