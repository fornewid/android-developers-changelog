 ## Library checksums and signatures
 
-Library authors can provide two pieces of metadata that can help verify the authenticity of the dependencies you are downloading. You define a file named`gradle/verification-metadata.xml`to specify which values you approve. It can contain:
-
-- **Checksums**- a hash of an artifact that you can use to verify that the artifact was not corrupted during transport. If the checksum was retrieved from a trusted source, it tells you that the artifact has not changed, reducing man-in-the-middle attacks.
-
-  The downside is that, because checksums are calculated from the artifacts, they change with every release, requiring you to update`gradle/verification-metadata.xml`whenever you upgrade them.
-- **Signatures**- allows dependency users to specify a public key for a given artifact in order to validate that this artifact was built and signed by the library author who is the authenticated owner of that public key. This is more work for the library author, but as long as their private key itself has not been compromised, the signature tells you the library is legitimate.
-
-  If the library author signs each version of an artifact with the same key, you don't need to update`gradle/verification-metadata.xml`when you upgrade them.

 ## Strip versions from trusted keys
 
-Signing keys rarely change between releases of a library. The generated data in the`gradle/verification-metadata.xml`file contains version details, meaning You would need to re-add key information for each new dependency version.
