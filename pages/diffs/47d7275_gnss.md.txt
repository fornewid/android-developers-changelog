 [Suplclient](https://github.com/google/supl-client) is sample code that accesses supl.google.com to obtain real time ephemeris. The `SuplTester` class provides an example on how to use the SUPL Client Project. The `SuplTester` sets up the SUPL TCP connection specifications, then at a given latitude and longitude sends an LPP SUPL request and prints the SUPL server response.
