-# Connect devices wirelessly
-
-Besides enabling communication with the cloud, Android's wireless APIs also enable communication with other devices on the same local network, and even devices which are not on a network, but are physically nearby. The addition of Network Service Discovery (NSD) takes this further by allowing an application to seek out a nearby device running services with which it can communicate. Integrating this feature into your application helps you provide a wide range of features, such as playing games with users in the same room, pulling images from a networked NSD-enabled webcam, or remotely logging into other machines on the same network.
-
-This class describes the key APIs for finding and connecting to other devices from your application. Specifically, it describes the NSD API for discovering available services and the Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer (P2P) API for doing peer-to-peer wireless connections. This class also shows you how to use NSD and Wi-Fi P2P in combination to detect the services offered by a device and connect to the device when neither device is connected to a network.
-
-If you're looking for a higher-level API for your Android application to transfer data reliably and securely between devices using a combination of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, consider using the[Nearby Connections API](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview).
