 Here's what you need to achieve:
 
-- **Minimum target** : As part of our[Android XR app quality guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/android-xr), we recommend aiming for 72fps at a minimum.
+- **Minimum target** : As part of our [Android XR app quality guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/android-xr), we recommend aiming for 72fps at a minimum.
 - **Ideal target**: 90fps target, which means your app has an 11ms budget per frame.
 
-These frame budgets not only avoid discomfort for users, but they also help your app provide a smooth, comfortable XR experience.
