-# Create a group of notifications
+Starting in Android 7.0 (API level 24), you can display related notifications in
+a group. For example, if your app shows notifications for received emails, put
+all notifications for new email messages in the same group so they collapse
+together.

-To support older versions, add a summary notification that appears alone to summarize all the separate notifications. This is often best done with the[inbox-style notification](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/expanded#inbox-style).

 ## Create a group and add a notification to it
 
-To create a notification group, define a unique identifier string for the group. Then, for each notification you want in the group, call[`setGroup()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setGroup(java.lang.String)), passing the group name. For example:

-By default, notifications are sorted according to when they are posted, but you can change the order by calling[`setSortKey()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setSortKey(java.lang.String)).

 ## Set a group summary
 
-Grouped notifications must have an extra notification that acts as the group summary. To enable grouped notifications, you must set a group summary. This group summary must include some of the text from each of the other notifications in the group to help the user understand what is in the group. How the group summary is displayed depends on the Android version:
-
-- On Android versions lower than 7.0 (API level 24), which can't show a nested group of notifications, the system only shows your group summary notification and hides all the others. The user can tap the group summary notification to open your app.
-
-- On Android 7.0 and higher, the system shows your group summary notification as a nested group of notifications, labeled with snippets of text from each grouped notification. It doesn't display the text you set on the group summary notification. The user can expand the nested group of notifications to see the individual notifications in the group, as shown in figure 1.
-
-Even if newer versions of Android don't show the group summary text that you design,*you always need to manually set a summary to enable grouped notifications*. The behavior of the group summary might vary on some device types, such as wearables. Setting rich content on your group summary helps provide the best experience on all devices and versions.

 ## Automatic grouping
 
-On Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher, if your app sends notifications and doesn't specify a group key or group summary, the system might automatically group them together. Notifications grouped automatically appear with a group summary notification labeled with snippets of text from some of the grouped notifications. The user can expand this summary notification to see each individual notification, as with manually grouped notifications.
