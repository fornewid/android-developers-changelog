-The Recall API lets games manage links between Google Play Games Services (PGS) users and
-their in-game accounts by storing *recall tokens* with Google servers. Here's a
-sample scenario of how the Recall API might be used.
+The Recall API helps you seamlessly link Google Play Games Services users to their in-game
+accounts, enabling automatic progress restoration. You store *recall tokens*
+in game servers, which associate these tokens with a user's Google Play Games Services
+profile. Using Recall API is optional and is the recommended method for
+implementing [seamless restore](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/seamless-restore#bind-iga-pgs-id) if you don't have your own
+robust identity backend.
+
+## Terminology
+
+This document uses the following terminology:
+
+**Recall token**: A secure key stored on game servers that acts as
+a link between a player's Play Games Services account and their
+in-game account.
+
+**session ID**: A temporary, unique identifier generated by the
+Play Games Services SDK on the player's device. It indicates
+that a request made by your backend server originated from a legitimate, active
+game session on a player's device.

+## Sample scenarios
