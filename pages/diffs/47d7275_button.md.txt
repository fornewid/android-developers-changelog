 To create a state list drawable for your button background, do the following:
 
-1. Create three bitmaps for the button background that represent the default, tapped, and focused button states. To ensure that your images fit buttons of various sizes, create the bitmaps as[nine-patch](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics#nine-patch)bitmaps.
