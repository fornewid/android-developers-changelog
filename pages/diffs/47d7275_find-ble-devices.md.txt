-# Find BLE devices
-
-To find BLE devices, you use the[`startScan()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/le/BluetoothLeScanner#startScan(android.bluetooth.le.ScanCallback))method. This method takes a[`ScanCallback`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/le/ScanCallback)as a parameter. You must implement this callback, because that is how scan results are returned. Because scanning is battery-intensive, you should observe the following guidelines:

+You must implement this callback, because that is how scan results are returned.
+Because scanning is battery-intensive, you should observe the following
+guidelines:
 
 - As soon as you find the desired device, stop scanning.
 - Never scan on a loop, and always set a time limit on your scan. A device that was previously available may have moved out of range, and continuing to scan drains the battery.
 
-In the following example, the BLE app provides an activity (`DeviceScanActivity`) to scan for available Bluetooth LE devices and display them in a list to the user. The following snippet shows how to start and stop a scan:
