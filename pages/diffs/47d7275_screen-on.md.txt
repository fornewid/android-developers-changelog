 ## Manually keep the screen on
 
-To keep the device's screen on, set the[`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON)flag in your activity. This flag may only be set in an activity, never in a service or other app component. For example:

-Using`android:keepScreenOn="true"`is equivalent to using[`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON). You can use whichever approach is best for your app. The advantage of setting the flag programmatically in your activity is that it gives you the option of programmatically clearing the flag later and thereby allowing the screen to turn off.

-If an app with the`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`flag goes into the background, the system allows the screen to turn off normally. You don't need to explicitly clear the flag in this case. If your app no longer needs to keep the screen on, you should clear the flag. by calling[`clearFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window#clearFlags(int)).

 ### Ambient Mode for TV
 
-On TV devices, use[`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON)to prevent the device from going into[Ambient Mode](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/playback/ambient-mode)during active video playback. If the foreground activity does not set`FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`, the device automatically enters Ambient Mode after a period of inactivity.
