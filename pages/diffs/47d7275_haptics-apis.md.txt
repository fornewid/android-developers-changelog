 #### Check for vibration primitive support
 
-| **Caution:** If a composition contains primitives that aren't supported by the device, the entire `VibrationEffect.Composition` won't play any vibration. Therefore, to ensure a predictable experience, the set of primitives used in your app should be checked for support when considering which haptic experiences to enable.

 Per-primitive support can be retrieved using the
 [`Vibrator.arePrimitivesSupported`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator#arePrimitivesSupported(int...)) method. Alternatively, a set of primitives
 may be checked together by using the [`Vibrator.areAllPrimitivesSupported`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Vibrator#areAllPrimitivesSupported(int...))
 method - this is equivalent to `AND`-ing the per-primitive support.
-| **Note:** The support for checking individual primitives is fully available starting in Android 12 (SDK 31). In Android 11, the check relies only in the ability to compose primitives, returning `TRUE` for all requested primitive IDs.
