-# USB host and accessory overview
-
-Android supports a variety of USB peripherals and Android USB accessories (hardware that implements the Android accessory protocol) through two modes: USB accessory and USB host. In USB accessory mode, the external USB hardware acts as the USB host. Examples of accessories might include:

Android USB accessories must be designed to work with Android-powered devices and must adhere to the[Android accessory communication protocol](http://accessories.android.com/demokit). In USB host mode, the Android-powered device acts as the host. Examples of devices include digital cameras, keyboards, mice, and game controllers. USB devices that are designed for a wide range of applications and environments can still interact with Android applications that can correctly communicate with the device.

-USB accessory and host modes are directly supported in Android 3.1 (API level 12) or newer platforms. USB accessory mode is also backported to Android 2.3.4 (API level 10) as an add-on library to support a broader range of devices. Device manufacturers can choose whether or not to include the add-on library on the device\\'s system image.

-**Note:** Support for USB host and accessory modes are ultimately dependant on the device\\'s hardware, regardless of platform level. You can filter for devices that support USB host and accessory through a[`<uses-feature>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element)element.

 ## Debug considerations
 
-When debugging applications that use USB accessory or host features, you most likely have USB hardware connected to your Android-powered device. This prevents you from having an`adb`connection to the Android-powered device using USB. You can still access`adb`over a network connection. To enable`adb`over a network connection:

 1. Connect the Android-powered device using USB to your computer.

-3. Enter`adb connect <device-ip-address>:5555`You should now be connected to the Android-powered device and can issue the usual`adb`commands like`adb logcat`.
-4. To set your device to listen on USB, enter`adb usb`.
