 ## Preference categories
 
-If you have several related[`Preference`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/preference)objects on a single screen, you can group them using a[`PreferenceCategory`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/preference/PreferenceCategory). A`PreferenceCategory`displays a category title and visually separates the category.

 ## Split your hierarchy into multiple screens
 
-If you have a large number of`Preference`objects or distinct categories, you can display them on separate screens. Each screen is a`PreferenceFragmentCompat`with its own separate hierarchy.`Preference`objects on your initial screen can then link to subscreens that contain related preferences.

 ### Use separate Activities
 
-Alternatively, if you need to heavily customize each screen, or if you want full`Activity`transitions between screens, you can use a separate`Activity`for each`PreferenceFragmentCompat`. By doing this, you can fully customize each`Activity`and its corresponding settings screen. For most apps, we don't recommended this; instead, use`Fragments`as previously described.
