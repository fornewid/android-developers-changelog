-# Connect to a GATT server
-
-The first step in interacting with a BLE device is connecting to it. More specifically, connecting to the GATT server on the device. To connect to a GATT server on a BLE device, use the[`connectGatt()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice#connectGatt(android.content.Context,%20boolean,%20android.bluetooth.BluetoothGattCallback))method. This method takes three parameters: a[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context)object,`autoConnect`(a boolean indicating whether to automatically connect to the BLE device as soon as it becomes available), and a reference to a[`BluetoothGattCallback`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback):

 ## Set up a bound service
 
-In the following example, the BLE app provides an activity (`DeviceControlActivity`) to connect to Bluetooth devices, display device data, and display the GATT services and characteristics supported by the device. Based on user input, this activity communicates with a[`Service`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service)called`BluetoothLeService`, which interacts with the BLE device via the BLE API. The communication is performed using a[bound service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services)which allows the activity to connect to the`BluetoothLeService`and call functions to connect to the devices. The`BluetoothLeService`needs a[`Binder`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder)implementation that provides access to the service for the activity.
