-- The source app must set either or both of the[`DRAG_FLAG_GLOBAL_URI_READ`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#DRAG_FLAG_GLOBAL_URI_READ)and[`DRAG_FLAG_GLOBAL_URI_WRITE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#DRAG_FLAG_GLOBAL_URI_WRITE)flags, depending on the read or write access to the data that the source app wants to grant to the target app.
-- The target app must call[`requestDragAndDropPermissions()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#requestDragAndDropPermissions(android.view.DragEvent))immediately before handling the data that the user drags into the app. If the target app no longer needs access to the dragged data, the app can then call[`release()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/DragAndDropPermissions#release())on the object that was returned from`requestDragAndDropPermissions()`. Otherwise, the permissions are released when the containing activity is destroyed. If your implementation involves starting a new Activity to process the dropped URIs, you will need to grant the new Activity the same permissions. You must set the clip data and a flag:
