 ### Step 1: Declare premium capability intents
 
-In order for your app's request for a premium slicing capability to be honored, your app must declare its intent to request that capability in the app manifest. Otherwise, the network request fails throwing a`SecurityException`.

-To do this, your app must declare the[`PackageManager.PROPERTY_SELF_CERTIFIED_NETWORK_CAPABILITIES`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager#PROPERTY_SELF_CERTIFIED_NETWORK_CAPABILITIES)property in the`AndroidManifest.xml`file and include a corresponding XML resource file.
