 ## Customize benchmark and Baseline Profile build types
 
-The Baseline Profile Gradle plugin creates additional build types to generate the profiles and to run benchmarks. These build types are prefixed with`benchmark`and`nonMinified`. For example, for the`release`build type, the plugin creates the`benchmarkRelease`and`nonMinifiedRelease`build types. These build types are automatically configured for the specific use case and don't generally need any customization. But there are some cases in which it might still be useful to apply some custom options, for example to apply a different signing config.
