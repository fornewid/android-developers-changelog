-# Implement haptics on Android
+Haptics is everything you feel through the sense of touch. Modern Android
+devices often incorporate a vibration actuator to allow devices to stimulate the
+user's sense of touch. These motors have advanced significantly from the
+original loud buzzy vibration produced by early devices, and Android apps can
+now take advantage of capabilities to give users a richer experience with
+subtlety and depth.
