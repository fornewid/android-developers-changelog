-Your choice of a coordinate system---in other words, your choice of what 1*world unit* means---goes hand in hand with your choice of brush epsilon value. The coordinate system is reflected in the inputToWorld transform matrix value you pass to[`InProgressStrokesView.startStroke()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/ink/authoring/InProgressStrokesView#startStroke(androidx.ink.strokes.StrokeInput,androidx.ink.brush.Brush,android.graphics.Matrix))and the similar transform you apply to the`Canvas`when drawing dry strokes.

-If your app supports panning, zooming, or rotating a drawing surface, then the exact value of those transform matrices will change over time, but those changes reflect a change in how your world coordinate system is being viewed by the*camera*that the user views the drawing surface through.

-The world coordinate system can be envisioned as a grid with each cell being the size of a world unit. Epsilon is a size in that grid, a floating point number of world units.

-The internal implementation uses epsilon to determine how close two points must be to each other to be treated as the same point. In other words, any distance less than epsilon is treated as zero distance. This is used to quantize and round internal calculations.

 ## What are reasonable world unit sizes and epsilon values?
 
-For portability across different screen sizes and[device densities](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities), the world unit size should be density independent. The classic unit for such scenarios is density-independent pixels (dp). Typically choose 1 dp as your world unit size.

+world unit size.
 
-When choosing a fixed epsilon value, avoid the internal implementation rounding numbers to any distance that would be larger than a pixel. With a world unit size of 1 dp, epsilon should be at most 1/4 (0.25 world units) to be the size of a pixel on high display density devices where 1 dp can be 4 px. However, if you want to support the user zooming in on their content by up to 10x and still keep epsilon-related rounding to 1 px or less, then epsilon should be 0.25 divided by 10, which equals 0.025 world units.

-This doesn't mean that you can't zoom in further than 10x, but you might start seeing some imprecision and artifacts in the stroke rendering at that point.

-Deviating too far from these recommended values can adversely affect your application. For example, increased resource consumption can make your application run slowly. In some cases, floating-point precision issues can also manifest as strange visual artifacts.
