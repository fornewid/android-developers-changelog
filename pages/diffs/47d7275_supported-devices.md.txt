-# AGI supported devices
-
 This page contains a growing list of Android devices that are supported by AGI.
 
-AGI requires support from the Android OS, OEM drivers, and the hardware for GPU profiling. AGI runs a[validation check](https://developer.android.com/agi/start#device-validation)the first time you connect a new device to check for profiling support. The devices listed below and new devices with Android 12 (except some Android-Go devices) are expected to pass this validation check.

-We recommend profiling on a Pixel 4 or 6, as these have been tested with the most applications on AGI. In the future this level of testing will be expanded to more devices.
