 To create a notification action that supports direct reply, follow these steps:
 
 1. Create an instance of `https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/RemoteInput.Builder` that you can add to your notification action. This class's constructor accepts a string that the system uses as the key for the text input. Your app later uses that key to retrieve the text of the input. \* {Kotlin} \`\`\`kotlin // Key for the string that's delivered in the action's intent. private val KEY_TEXT_REPLY = "key_text_reply" var replyLabel: String = resources.getString(R.string.reply_label) var remoteInput: RemoteInput = RemoteInput.Builder(KEY_TEXT_REPLY).run { setLabel(replyLabel) build() } \`\`\` \* {Java} \`\`\`java // Key for the string that's delivered in the action's intent. private static final String KEY_TEXT_REPLY = "key_text_reply"; String replyLabel = getResources().getString(R.string.reply_label); RemoteInput remoteInput = new RemoteInput.Builder(KEY_TEXT_REPLY) .setLabel(replyLabel) .build(); \`\`\`
-2. Create a `PendingIntent` for the reply action. \* {Kotlin} \`\`\`kotlin // Build a PendingIntent for the reply action to trigger. var replyPendingIntent: PendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(applicationContext, conversation.getConversationId(), getMessageReplyIntent(conversation.getConversationId()), PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT) \`\`\` \* {Java} \`\`\`java // Build a PendingIntent for the reply action to trigger. PendingIntent replyPendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(getApplicationContext(), conversation.getConversationId(), getMessageReplyIntent(conversation.getConversationId()), PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT); \`\`\` **Caution:** If you reuse a `PendingIntent`, a user might reply to a different conversation than the one they intend. You must provide a request code that is different for each conversation or provide an intent that doesn't return `true` when you call `https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent#equals(java.lang.Object)` on the reply intent of any other conversation. The conversation ID is frequently passed as part of the intent's extras bundle, but is ignored when you call `equals()`.
