 ## Enable foveated rendering
 
-Foveated rendering offers both static and eye-tracking optimizations that improve GPU performance. However, the eye tracked implementation offers a better quality to users by rendering the area where they are looking, while reducing the quality of their peripheral vision. This significantly reduces GPU workload while maintaining visual quality where it matters most.
