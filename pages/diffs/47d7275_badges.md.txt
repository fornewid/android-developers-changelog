-# Modify a notification badge
-
-Starting with Android 8.0 (API level 26), notification badges---also known as notification dots---appear on a launcher icon when the associated app has an active notification. Users can touch \& hold the app icon to reveal the notifications, along with any[app shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts), as shown in figure 1.
-
-These dots appear by default in launcher apps that support them, and there's nothing your app needs to do. However, there might be situations in which you don't want the to notification dot to appear or you want to control exactly which notifications appear there.

 ## Disable badging
 
-There are cases where badges don't make sense for your notifications, so you can disable them on a per-channel basis by calling[`setShowBadge(false)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel#setShowBadge(boolean))on your[`NotificationChannel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)object.

 - Ongoing notifications: most ongoing notifications, such as image processing, media playback controls, or current navigation instructions, don't make sense as a badge.
 - Calendar reminders: avoid badging events occurring at the current time.
 - Clock or alarm events: avoid badging notifications related to current alarms.

 ## Set custom notification count
 
-By default, each notification increments a number displayed on the touch \& hold menu, as shown in figure 1, but you can override this number for your app. For example, this might be useful if you're using just one notification to represent multiple new messages but want the count to represent the number of total new messages.
