-# Transfer Bluetooth data
-
-After you have successfully[connected to a Bluetooth device](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/bluetooth/connect-bluetooth-devices), each one has a connected[`BluetoothSocket`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothSocket). You can now share information between devices. Using the`BluetoothSocket`, the general procedure to transfer data is as follows:
-
-1. Get the[`InputStream`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/InputStream)and[`OutputStream`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/OutputStream)that handle transmissions through the socket using[`getInputStream()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothSocket#getInputStream())and[`getOutputStream()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothSocket#getOutputStream()), respectively.
-
-2. Read and write data to the streams using[`read(byte[])`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/InputStream#read(byte%5B%5D))and[`write(byte[])`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/OutputStream#write(byte%5B%5D)).
-
-There are, of course, implementation details to consider. In particular, you should use a dedicated thread for reading from the stream and writing to it. This is important because both the`read(byte[])`and`write(byte[])`methods are blocking calls. The`read(byte[])`method blocks until there is something to read from the stream. The`write(byte[])`method doesn't usually block, but it can block for flow control if the remote device isn't calling`read(byte[])`quickly enough and the intermediate buffers become full as a result. So, you should dedicate your main loop in the thread to reading from the`InputStream`. You can use a separate public method in the thread to initiate writes to the`OutputStream`.

-After the constructor acquires the necessary streams, the thread waits for data to come through the`InputStream`. When`read(byte[])`returns with data from the stream, the data is sent to the main activity using a member[`Handler`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler)from the parent class. The thread then waits for more bytes to be read from the`InputStream`.
-
-To send outgoing data, you call the thread's`write()`method from the main activity and pass in the bytes to be sent. This method calls`write(byte[])`to send the data to the remote device. If an[`IOException`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/IOException)is thrown when calling`write(byte[])`, the thread sends a toast to the main activity, explaining to the user that the device couldn't send the given bytes to the other (connected) device.
-
-The thread's`cancel()`method allows you to terminate the connection at any time by closing the`BluetoothSocket`. Always call this method when you're done using the Bluetooth connection.
