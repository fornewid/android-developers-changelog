+XR headsets use high-resolution cameras to capture the physical world and stream

 - **Visuals**: Because the display is opaque, it can render "true black" and fully occlude the real world. This allows for complete virtual immersion (VR) where the physical environment is replaced entirely.
 - **Field of View**: Headsets typically offer a wide field of view (110°+), allowing for immersive, peripheral-filling interfaces.

-Wired XR glasses use additive light displays (such as waveguides) to project light onto semi-transparent lenses. Users view the physical world directly through the glass, with digital content overlaid on top.

 - **Additive color \& transparency**: In an additive display, pure black renders as transparent. Darker colors are rendered by emitting less light, which effectively reduces their opacity.
 - **Field of View**: The FOV is more focused, typically between 50° and 70°. While this still provides a wide-screen experience, it's narrower than a headset. UI scaling automatically adjusts content to keep it within this focused area.

 - **Additive color \& transparency**: Some AI glasses feature an additive display, where pure black renders as transparent. Darker colors are rendered by emitting less light, which effectively reduces their opacity.
 - **Mobility**: AI glasses are lightweight and portable, letting the user wear them as they go about daily life.
 - **Inputs**: Primary inputs often include physical input such as a touchpad and voice input using the microphone array.
-- **AI first**: AI glasses provide a unique opportunity for new interaction design with the overlap of a new, highly-contextual and personal form factor with evolving AI patterns. For AI glasses, you will have access to the device's hardware and features, including camera, microphone, and touchpad, to fully explore new interaction patterns between AI, your app, and glasses with comfort and user safety principles in mind.
