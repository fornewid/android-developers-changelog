 ## How voice input works
 
-1. The user requests voice input (via the microphone icon in the action strip,

 2. An overlay appears, signaling that recording is in process.
-3. Users can stop the recording by dismissing the overlay, or they can stop

 ## Best practices
 
-* **Get permission first.** Make sure the user has granted permission for your
-  app to access the car's microphone (ideally before the drive starts).
-* **Provide an entry point.** Give the user a way to start voice input, such
-  as a microphone icon in the action strip. Then, wait for them to initiate
-  the process.
-* **Brand the experience.** When creating an in-app assistant, make clear that
-  it's an assistant specific to your app.
-* **Stop when the user does.** When the user is done talking, stop recording.
