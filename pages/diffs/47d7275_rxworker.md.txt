-# Threading in RxWorker
+We provide interoperability between WorkManager and RxJava. To get started,
+include [`work-rxjava3` dependency in addition to `work-runtime`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work#declaring_dependencies) in your gradle file.
+There is also a `work-rxjava2` dependency that supports rxjava2 instead.
