 ## Android XR Emulator
 
-The Android XR Emulator provides virtualized XR devices for testing and debugging your XR apps in Android Studio. It emulates XR devices, allowing you to experience your app in a 3D spatial environment. This lets you build your apps without the need for physical hardware during early development stages, streamlining your workflow and accelerating iteration.
-| **Note:** The emulator is designed for developing Android apps in Android Studio. It's not currently supported for OpenXR or Unity applications of any kind.

 ## Use the Android Studio Layout Inspector with an XR app
 
-Once you have started building your spatial panels and orbiters, you can inspect your layout with the Android Studio Layout Inspector. If you are unfamiliar with the Layout Inspector, see our[guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/layout-inspector)on layout debugging.
