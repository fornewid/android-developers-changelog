-# Screen calls
-
-Devices that run Android 10 (API level 29) or higher allow your app to identify calls from numbers that aren't in the user's address book as potential spam calls. Users can choose to have spam calls silently rejected. To provide greater transparency to users when they miss calls, information about these blocked calls is logged in the call log. Using the Android 10 API eliminates the requirement to obtain the[`READ_CALL_LOG`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_CALL_LOG)permission from the user in order to provide call screening and caller ID functionality.
-
-You use a[`CallScreeningService`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/CallScreeningService)implementation to screen calls. Call the[`onScreenCall()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/CallScreeningService#onScreenCall(android.telecom.Call.Details))function for any new incoming or outgoing calls when the number is not in the user's contact list. You can check the[`Call.Details`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/Call.Details)object for information about the call. Specifically, the[`getCallerNumberVerificationStatus()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/Call.Details#getCallerNumberVerificationStatus())function includes information from the network provider about the other number. If the verification status failed, this is a good indication that the call is from an invalid number or a potential spam call.
