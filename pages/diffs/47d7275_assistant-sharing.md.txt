-Users on Android phones can ask Google Assistant to share app content with another user using a voice command like*"Hey Google, send this to Jane."*Based on the first user's system options, Assistant can then incorporate text from the screen or a device screenshot in the shared content.

-This method of sharing is often sufficient, but users who receive content shared from your app might not re-enter the app to view content. You can provide Assistant with structured information about the current foreground content by implementing the[`onProvideAssistContent()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onProvideAssistContent(android.app.assist.AssistContent))method.

-This process helps maintain the structure of data as it's shared to another user. Users who receive shared app content can then be deep linked or receive content directly, instead of as text or as a screenshot.

 ## Provide content to Assistant
 
-You only need to implement`onProvideAssistContent()`for the final app activity in the user's task flow after invoking the App Action. For example, in a`GET_ITEM_LIST`flow, implement the method in the final screen showing the item list; you don't need to implement it for any in-progress or preview screens.
