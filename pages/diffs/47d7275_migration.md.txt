-# Migrate to Google Play services location and context APIs
+Google recommends using the [location and context
+APIs](https://developers.google.com/location-context/) in Google Play services
+in apps that require location services. If your app uses the [framework location
+APIs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/package-summary) it's important to
+migrate to Google Play services to take advantage of the latest Google-powered
+features.

 ### Set up Google Play services in your project
 
-To make the location and context APIs available to your project you must add a reference to the Google maven repository and declare a dependency to the required APIs. For more information, see[Set Up Google Play services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup).

 ### Use Google Play services for complex features
 
-Google Play services libraries help you implement novel user experiences around context and awareness of the user's surroundings. The various[location and context](https://developers.google.com/location-context/)libraries leverage additional sensors beyond just location, and do so in a power-efficient way, providing your app with more accurate data while reducing the impact on battery life.

 ### Replace the framework location API with the fused location provider API
 
-You can use the fused location provider API to get location data, such as latitude and longitude. The fused location provider API uses a[`Location`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location)object---just like the location framework API---to represent geographic location. The API provides features to listen for location updates as well as to get the last known location. All these features make the fused location provider API a good candidate to replace the components that use the framework location API with minimal changes to the rest of the app.

-[Getting the last known location](https://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current)is a good starting point for many experiences because it's a fast operation that uses location data requested by any client on the device. To periodically track location, your app can subscribe to[receive location updates](https://developer.android.com/training/location/receive-location-updates), which provides up-to-date data and enables more complex experiences.

 ### Remove references to the framework location API
 
-Replace references to classes in the`com.google.android.location`package with classes from the`com.google.android.gms.location`package, except references to the[`Location`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location)class, which the fused location provider API uses. You can usually remove the components that manage the different providers, such as GPS and Wi-Fi, from your app. The location and context APIs automatically manage these providers.
