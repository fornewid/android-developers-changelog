-# Darken web content in WebView
-
-In Android 10 and higher, an app can support a[Dark theme](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/theming/darktheme)and automatically change between light and dark app themes according to the system theme. To match the current app theme, web content in[WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView)can also use light, dark, or default styling.
-
-WebView's behavior interoperates with the[`prefers-color-scheme`](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme)and[`color-scheme`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-adjust-1/#propdef-color-scheme)web standards. When possible, if you author the web content that you want your app to display in WebView, you should[define a dark theme for your website](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/#supporting-dark-mode)and implement`prefers-color-scheme`so that WebView can match the web content's theme to your app's theme.
-
-The following table describes how WebView renders web content in your app, depending on the web content's styling and your app's conditions:

 ## Content-author styling
 
-An app's[`isLightTheme`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable#Theme_isLightTheme)attribute indicates if the app's theme is light or dark. WebView always sets`prefers-color-scheme`according to`isLightTheme`. If`isLightTheme`is`true`or not specified, then`prefers-color-scheme`is`light`; otherwise, it is`dark`.

 ## Algorithmic darkening
 
-To cover cases where web content doesn't use[`prefers-color-scheme`](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme), your app can allow WebView, when necessary, to algorithmically apply a dark theme to web content that it renders.

-- The current activity theme is marked as light with[`isLightTheme`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable#Theme_isLightTheme)set to`true`.
+- The current activity theme is marked as light with [`isLightTheme`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.styleable#Theme_isLightTheme) set to `true`.
 - The web content author doesn't explicitly disable darkening.
-- For apps targeting Android 13 (API level 33) or higher, the web content doesn't use`prefers-color-scheme`.
-- For apps targeting Android 12 (API level 32) or lower: The app has set[WebView's`forceDarkMode`setting](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/webkit/WebSettingsCompat#setForceDark(android.webkit.WebSettings,int))to[`FORCE_DARK_AUTO`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/webkit/WebSettingsCompat#FORCE_DARK_AUTO())and has set their Force Dark strategy to[`DARK_STRATEGY_USER_AGENT_DARKENING_ONLY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/webkit/WebSettingsCompat#DARK_STRATEGY_USER_AGENT_DARKENING_ONLY()).

-WebView and all its parents can allow force dark using[`View.setForceDarkAllowed()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setForceDarkAllowed(boolean)). The default value is taken from the`setForceDarkAllowed()`attribute of the Android theme, which must also be set to`true`.
