-# Transfer BLE data
-
-Once you have[connected to a BLE GATT server](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/bluetooth/connect-gatt-server), you can use the connection to find out what services are available on the device, query data from the device, and request notifications when a certain GATT characteristic changes.
+Once you have [connected to a BLE GATT
+server](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/bluetooth/connect-gatt-server), you can use
+the connection to find out what services are available on the device, query data
+from the device, and request notifications when a certain GATT characteristic
+changes.
 
 ## Discover services
 
-The first thing to do once you connect to the GATT Server on the BLE device is to perform service discovery. This provides information about the services available on the remote device as well as the service characteristics and their descriptors. In the following example, once the service successfully connects to the device (indicated by the appropriate call to the[`onConnectionStateChange()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback#onConnectionStateChange(android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt,%20int,%20int))function of the[`BluetoothGattCallback`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback)), the[`discoverServices()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGatt#discoverServices())function queries the information from the BLE device.

-The service needs to override the[`onServicesDiscovered()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback#onServicesDiscovered(android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt,%20int))function in the[`BluetoothGattCallback`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGattCallback). This function is called when the device reports on its available services.
