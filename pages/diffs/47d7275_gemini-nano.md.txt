-For on-device use-cases, you can take advantage of Google's Gemini Nano foundation model.[Gemini Nano runs in Android's AICore system service](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/a-new-foundation-for-ai-on-android.html), which leverages device hardware to enable low inference latency and keeps the model up-to-date.
