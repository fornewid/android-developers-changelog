-The[SociaLite sample app](https://github.com/android/socialite)demonstrates how to use Android platform APIs to implement features that are commonly deployed in social network and communications apps. We have integrated the Gemini API using the Firebase AI Logic SDK to demonstrate how chatbot capabilities can be implemented in your own Android apps.

To implement an AI-driven chatbot in the Socialite demo, we used the[*system instructions*](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/system-instructions)functionality of the Gemini API to modify the behavior of the model.

This Gemini-infused version of SociaLite also uses the multimodal capabilities of the model to let the chatbot react to images.

 ## Implement the Gemini API
 
-The chatbot implementation is primarily located in the`ChatRepository`class. The`GenerativeModel`class lets you interact with the Gemini API, which is instantiated as follows:

 ## Test the AI chatbot
 
 You can test it yourself by following these steps:
 
-1. Check out the code for the[SociaLite sample app](https://github.com/android/socialite)and open it in Android Studio.
-2. Set up a Firebase Project, connect your app to the*Gemini Developer API* by following[these steps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started?platform=android&api=dev),
-3. Replace google-services.json with your own \& Run`app`configuration,
