-The Android drag-and-drop framework lets you add interactive drag-and-drop capabilities to your app. With drag and drop, users can copy or move text, images, objects, and any content that can be represented by a URI, from one[`View`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View)to another within an app, or between apps in[multi-window mode](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/drag-drop/multi-window#DragPermissionsMultiWindow).

-The framework includes a drag event class, drag listeners, and helper classes and methods. Although primarily designed to enable the transfer of data, you can use the framework for other UI actions. For example, you can create an app that mixes colors when the user drags a color icon over another icon. However, the rest of document describes the drag-and-drop framework in the context of data transfer.
