-Performance is fundamental to the success of your Unity app on Android XR. While poor performance in games and apps on non-XR devices can disrupt and frustrate users, poor performance on XR devices can cause more serious problems. For example, if your frame rate spikes or drops in an XR app, it might cause a user to experience motion sickness or headaches.
