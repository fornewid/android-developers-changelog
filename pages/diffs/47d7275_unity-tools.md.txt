 ## Enable Unity's Frame Debugger
 
-The[Frame Debugger](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/FrameDebugger.html)is Unity's built-in tool for analyzing how your scene is rendered frame by frame. This tool shows you the sequence of draw calls and lets you step through them to understand rendering behavior.

 ### Benefits
 
 - Identify rendering bottlenecks and unexpected draw calls.
-- Verify that the[SRP Batcher](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/urp-asset-settings#enable-srp-batcher)is working correctly (look for "RenderLoopNewBatcher" entries).
-- Check[GPU Resident Drawer](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/unity/performance/gpu-rendering#gpu-resident-drawer)batching (look for "Hybrid Batch Group" entries).
