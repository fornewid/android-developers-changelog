-One of the ways that you can communicate with your users is by using Text to Speech (TTS) technology. TTS is built into Android (requiring no additional libraries) and works even when offline. These characteristics makes TTS ideal for handling error conditions in displayless mode. You can reference TTS features using the[`TextToSpeech`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech)class.

-- [`TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech#queue_flush)indicates that the text should be spoken immediately and any other TTS utterance should be interrupted.
