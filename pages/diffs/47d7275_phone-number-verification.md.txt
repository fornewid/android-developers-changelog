-2. **Exchange the token for a phone number** : Your app's backend exchanges the`TS.43 token`with an aggregator or a carrier for the user's verified phone number.

 ## Prerequisites
 
-To implement phone number verification with the DigitalCredential API, you need an account with an aggregator. An aggregator interacts with carriers and provides the necessary API surface for your app, usually as a billable cloud API endpoint.
