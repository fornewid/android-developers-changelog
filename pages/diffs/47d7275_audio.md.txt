-Adjust the following performance-related Unity settings and follow these guidelines to prevent audio-related impacts on your app's performance.
+Adjust the following performance-related Unity settings and follow these
+guidelines to prevent audio-related impacts on your app's performance.
 
 - Limit simultaneous audio sources to avoid CPU spikes.
 - Enable spatial audio only on nearby sounds - use panning for distant sounds to reduce CPU load.
 - Avoid streaming from compressed Asset Bundles (even with LZ4) when dealing with music. The decompression overhead will cause high, spikey CPU usage that severely impacts performance.
-- In your Unity's project's audio settings, enable**Load in Background** and set the**Load type** to**Decompress on Load**to force the audio to pre-load.
