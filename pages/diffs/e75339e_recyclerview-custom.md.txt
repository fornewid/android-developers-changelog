 ach of which offers many customization options:
 
-- [LinearLayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/LinearLayoutManager): arranges the items in a one-dimensional list. Using a `RecyclerView` with `LinearLayoutManager` provides functionality like a [ListView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView) layout.

Using a `RecyclerView` with `GridLayoutManager` provides functionality like a [GridView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/GridView) layout.

    There are three key types you can use to identify selected items:
-   - [Parcelable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable) and its subclasses, like [Uri](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/Uri)

It is effectively a factory for [`ItemDetails`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/selection/ItemDetailsLookup.ItemDetails) instances that are backed up by, or extracted from, a [RecyclerView.ViewHolder](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder) instance.

    The selection library doesn't provide a default visual decoration for the

    We recommend the following approach:
-   - In `onBindViewHolder()`, call [setActivated()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setActivated(boolean))---**not** [setSelected()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setSelected(boolean))---on the `View` object with `true` or `false`, depending on whether the item is selected.

    - Update the styling of the view to represent the activated status. We recommend using a [color state
      list resource](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/color-list-resource) to configure the styling.
-5. Use [ActionMode](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/view/ActionMode) to provide the user with tools to perform an action on the selection.
-6. Register a [SelectionTracker.SelectionObserver](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/selection/SelectionTracker.SelectionObserver) to be notified when a selection changes. When a selection is first created, start `ActionMode` to present this to the user and provide selection-specific actions. For example, you can add a delete button to the `ActionMode` bar and connect the back arrow on the bar to clear the selection. When the selection becomes empty---if the user clears the selection the last time---terminate action mode.
