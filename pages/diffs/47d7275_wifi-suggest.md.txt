 On Android 11 (API level 30) and higher:
 
 - Provisioning a [`PasspointConfiguration`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/hotspot2/PasspointConfiguration) is supported by the suggestion API. Before Android 11, provisioning a `PasspointConfiguration` requires the use of the [`addOrUpdatePasspointConfiguration()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#addOrUpdatePasspointConfiguration(android.net.wifi.hotspot2.PasspointConfiguration)) API.
 - The framework enforces security requirements on TLS-based Enterprise suggestions (EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and EAP-PEAP); suggestions to such networks must set a [`Root CA certificate`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiEnterpriseConfig#setCaCertificates(java.security.cert.X509Certificate%5B%5D)) and a [`server domain name`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiEnterpriseConfig#setAltSubjectMatch(java.lang.String)).
 
-| **Note:** Insecure suggestions retained from an earlier version of Android are ignored in Android 11 and higher. The suggesting app must replace its old suggestions with new and secure suggestions.

 - The framework enforces ownership requirements for EAP-SIM based Enterprise suggestions (EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, EAP-AKA-PRIME); such suggestions are allowed only by apps that are carrier-signed.
 - For suggestions provided by a carrier-signed app, the framework automatically assigns them a carrier ID corresponding to the app's [carrier signing](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/uicc). Such suggestions are automatically disabled if the corresponding SIM is removed from the device.
