-| Recommendation | thumb_up Recommended | thumb_down Not recommended |

 | ##### Contractions Use contractions in TTS prompts. Messages without contractions sound stilted and robotic rather than natural and conversational. Speaking words like "cannot" and "do not" can sound punishing and harsh. | **`ResponseSpeech`** (TTS) Sorry, I can't find a reservation. **`ResponseText`** Sorry, I can't find a reservation. | **`ResponseSpeech`** (TTS) Sorry, I cannot find a reservation. **`ResponseText`** Sorry, I cannot find a reservation. |
 | ##### Commas Add clarity by using serial commas in lists of three or more items. Without the serial comma, individual items in your list might be incorrectly heard, or read as groups. For example, in "daffodils, daisies and sunflowers," "daisies and sunflowers" sound like they come together. In "daffodils, daisies, and sunflowers," all three are clearly separate. | **`ResponseSpeech`** (TTS) Our most popular ones include yellow roses, daffodils, daisies, and sunflowers. **`ResponseText`** Our most popular ones include yellow roses, daffodils, daisies, and sunflowers. | **`ResponseSpeech`** (TTS) Our most popular ones include yellow roses, daffodils, daisies and sunflowers. **`ResponseText`** Our most popular ones include yellow roses, daffodils, daisies and sunflowers. |
