 ### Key points about the code
 
-- The bundle is queried for two arrays. The first array includes all of the matches and the second is the speech recognizer's confidence in what was heard. The indices of these arrays correspond to each other. The match with the highest confidence value (`mostConfidentIndex`) is used.

 ### Alternative approaches when matching
 
-In the preceding example, the match with the highest confidence value is used. This choice means that the system must be pretty confident in what it understood from the user or it won't flag a match. When using this approach, you might get false negatives.

-Another approach could be to look through all of the matches regardless of confidence and find any match that fits the input you are looking for. In contrast, this kind of approach could lead to more false positives. The approach you should take is largely dependent on your usecase.
