-To promote features of your app and make it easier to use, you can suggest Assistant shortcuts to your users. Assistant shortcuts are concise phrases that a user can utter to trigger functionality within your app.

 The In-App Promo SDK provides the following methods:
 
-- **`lookupShortcut`:** checks whether the shortcut you want to suggest already exists. The method also checks for any issues that prevent the shortcut from being created. If the shortcut can't be created,`lookupShortcut`returns the reasons why.
