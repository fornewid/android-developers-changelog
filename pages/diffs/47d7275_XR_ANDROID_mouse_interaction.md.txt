 ## Overview
 
-This extension provides an[`XrPath`](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/html/xrspec.html#XrPath)for getting mouse input and defines one commonly used action pose for user mouse profiles, including both mouse devices and trackpad devices.

 ## Action pose for mouse interactions
 
-The following action pose (i.e. "aim") enables a 3D pointer ray, whether the tracking inputs are provided by a mouse device or a trackpad device.

 ### Aim pose
 
-The*.../input/aim/pose*is designed for interacting with objects through a mouse pointer in 3D space. For example, using a virtual laser pointer to aim at a virtual button on the wall is an interaction suited to the "aim" pose.

 **Position**
 
-The position of the "aim" pose is typically the user's head, that is, the same position of the head when a mouse movement is detected. The aim pose for the mouse is calculated when there is a mouse movement. The last known aim position will be kept until the next mouse movement.

-Depth movement will be supported using primary click and scroll. When an action to move in depth is in process, the position is offset from the head position in positive or negative Z-direction along the ray depending on the positive or negative scroll value. The system will stabilize the depth movement within the sphere around the user's head.

 ## The interaction profile for mouse devices
 
-The mouse interaction profile is designed for runtimes which provide mouse inputs using mouse devices or trackpad devices with buttons and scroll. This allows mouse devices and trackpad devices to provide commonly used clicks, scroll, and action pose to the[OpenXR action system](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/html/xrspec.html#input).
