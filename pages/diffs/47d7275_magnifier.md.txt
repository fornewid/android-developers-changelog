+Available in Android 9 (API level 28) and later, the magnifier widget is a
+virtual magnifying glass that displays an enlarged copy of a `View` through an
+overlay pane that represents the lens. The feature improves the text insertion
+and selection user experience. When applying the magnifier to text, a user can
+precisely position the cursor or the selection handles by viewing the magnified
+text in a pane that follows their finger.

 ## Additional considerations when magnifying text
 
-For the platform text widgets, it's important to understand specific magnifier behaviors and to enable the magnifier for your custom text view consistently across the Android platform. Consider the following:
+For the platform text widgets, it's important to understand specific magnifier
+behaviors and to enable the magnifier for your custom text view consistently
+across the Android platform. Consider the following:
 
 - The magnifier is triggered immediately when the user grabs an insertion or selection handle.
 - The magnifier always smoothly follows the user's finger horizontally, while vertically it is fixed to the center of the current text line.
