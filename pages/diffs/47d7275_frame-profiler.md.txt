-# Frame profiling overview
+With Android GPU Inspector (AGI), you can profile a specific frame of your Android app
+and use it to perform an in-depth analysis of the app's GPU usage. This
+profiling data can give you a deeper understand of your app's GPU usage than
+with [system profiling](https://developer.android.com/agi/sys-trace/system-profiler) alone.
