-# Analyze vertex memory bandwidth usage
-
 The memory bandwidth of vertex data can be a potential bottleneck for your game's GPU performance. There are some counters in an AGI system profile that can help diagnose vertex memory bandwidth issues.
 
 ## Qualcomm Adreno counters
 
 On devices with Qualcomm Adreno GPUs, some notable counters include:
 
-|       Counter        |                             Description                             |
-|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
-| Vertex Memory Read   | Bandwidth of vertex data read from external memory.                 |
-| Average Bytes/Vertex | Average size of vertex data, in bytes.                              |
+| Counter | Description |
+|---|---|
+| Vertex Memory Read | Bandwidth of vertex data read from external memory. |
+| Average Bytes/Vertex | Average size of vertex data, in bytes. |
 | % Vertex Fetch Stall | Percentage of clock cycles where the GPU is blocked on vertex data. |
 
 ## ARM Mali counters (WIP)
 
 On devices with ARM Mali GPUs, some notable counters include:
 
-|                  Counter                   |                                         Description                                          |
-|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
+| Counter | Description |
+|---|---|
 | Load/store read beats from external memory | Data beats read from external memory by the load/store unit, averaged over the shader cores. |
-| Load/store read beats from L2 cache        | Data beats read from the L2 cache by the load/store unit, averaged over the shader cores.    |
-| \[More\]                                   |                                                                                              |
+| Load/store read beats from L2 cache | Data beats read from the L2 cache by the load/store unit, averaged over the shader cores. |
+| \[More\] |   |
 
 To calculate the overall bandwidth from average read beats, the counter value is multiplied by the bus width (typically 16 bytes) and by the total number of shader cores. \[More\]
 
 ## Counter analysis
 
-To measure the behavior of these counters, you can measure the average and peak bandwidth over the course of a single GPU frame, which can be delineated with a contiguous block of**GPU Utilization**.

 We recommend a peak vertex memory read bandwidth of no higher than 1.5 GBps, and an average bandwidth no higher than 500 MBps. Higher values are indicators of one of a few common issues:

 - **Vertex attribute streams are not split**: Vertex attributes are interleaved into a single buffer, reducing cache efficiency.
 - **Too many vertices submitted per frame**: Complex models and/or a large number of models may take up greater bandwidth and take longer to shade.
 
-Vertex size issues may also be diagnosed through the**Average Bytes / Vertex**track, which we recommend to be no higher than 32 bytes or verteces.
