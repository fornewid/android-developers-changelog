-# Threading in CoroutineWorker
-
-For Kotlin users, WorkManager provides first-class support for[coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html). To get started, include[`work-runtime-ktx`in your gradle file](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work#declaring_dependencies). Instead of extending[`Worker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker), you should extend[`CoroutineWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/CoroutineWorker), which has a suspending version of`doWork()`. For example, if you wanted to build a simple`CoroutineWorker`to perform some network operations, you would do the following:

 ## Running a CoroutineWorker in a different process
 
-You can also bind a worker to a specific process by using[`RemoteCoroutineWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/multiprocess/RemoteCoroutineWorker), an implementation of`ListenableWorker`.
