 If you do not use CMake or ndk-build but want full integration of the Android Gradle plugin (AGP) C/C++ build and Android Studio, you can create a custom C/C++ build system by making a shell script that writes build information in the [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build file format.

 - `ninja.configure` is a path to a script file that will be executed by Gradle when it is necessary to configure the C/C++ project. A project is configured on the first build, during a Gradle sync in Android Studio, or when one of the configure script inputs changes.

   - `${ndk.buildRoot}` is the name of a folder, generated by AGP, that the script writes its output to. Details of this will be explained in [Step 2: Create the configure script](https://developer.android.com/build/configure-script-responsibilities).
 
   - `${ndk.ndkVersion}` is the version of the NDK to be used. This is usually the value passed to android.ndkVersion in the `build.gradle` file or a default value if none is present.
