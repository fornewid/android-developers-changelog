 Android lets you build on the power of the web within your app. So, you can
 benefit from the flexibility and efficiency of displaying certain types of
 content.

+The [`WebView`](/reference/android/webkit/WebView) API gives you access to the capabilities of a mini-browser
 for displaying web content within your app. This lets you provide web-powered
 experiences as a core or supporting part within your app, as seen in **Figure
