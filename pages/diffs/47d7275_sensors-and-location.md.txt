-# About sensors and location
+Android-powered devices have sensors that let you provide users with contextual
+information about their surroundings, including location awareness, motion,
+position, and qualities of the physical environment.

+- Use [GPS](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location) to add location awareness to your app with automated location
+  tracking, wrong-side-of-the-street detection, geofencing, activity
+  recognition, and more.

+- Use [motion sensors](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_motion) to measure acceleration forces and rotational forces
+  along three axes. This category includes accelerometers, gravity sensors,
