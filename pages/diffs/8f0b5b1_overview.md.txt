 ## Common use cases
 
-The Data Layer API is particularly useful for fitness and media use cases.
+Use the Data Layer API when the interaction is strictly between the
+watch and phone. For example:
 
-### Fitness apps
+- **Remote Control**: The watch acts as a remote for the phone (e.g., controlling a music player running on the phone, sliding a presentation, acting as a camera shutter).
+- **Handheld App Launching**: The "Open on Phone" button feature.
+- **Authentication Bridging**: Sending a session token from the phone to the watch during initial setup.
 
-Sending exercise data from Wear OS app to mobile app Fitness apps often need to
-write the exercise data captured by a watch to a mobile app or to [Health
-Connect](https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect). If using the Data Layer API to transfer data, use a
-[message client](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data/client-types#message-client) to send exercise data from the Wear OS app to the mobile app
-in order to write to Health Connect.
+Many common scenarios should instead use your existing cloud infrastructure, for
+example:
 
-#### Stream live data to the mobile device during a home workout
+- **Saving Data**: Workouts, notes.
+- **Fetching Content**: Loading a list of past workouts, downloading music, fetching weather.
+- **Syncing State**: If the user changes their profile photo on the web, the watch updates using the cloud, not by querying the phone.
 
-A [common home workout scenario](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/wear-os-home-workouts-with-health-services-b9951fa9e0dc) is streaming heart rate data from a Wear OS
-device to a mobile device and showing the user up-to-date heart rate information
-on their mobile device's screen. To stream this data, use a [channel client](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data/client-types#channel-client).
-
-### Media apps
-
-To control a media player through the action of pause/resume/start/end from the
-watch to the phone, use a [message client](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data/client-types#message-client).
+For these scenarios, use your own existing endpoints and infrastructure, instead
+of the Data Layer API.
