-- An*enter* transition determines how views in an activity enter the scene. For example, in the`explode`enter transition, the views enter the scene from the outside and fly inward to the center of the screen.
-- An*exit* transition determines how views in an activity exit the scene. For example, in the`explode`exit transition, the views exit the scene away from the center.
-- A*shared elements* transition determines how views that are shared between two activities transition between these activities. For example, if two activities have the same image in different positions and sizes, the`changeImageTransform`shared element transition translates and scales the image smoothly between these activities.
