-When you select a command in the**Commands** pane, the**Framebuffer**pane displays the contents of the framebuffer after that call finishes. If you select a command group, it displays the framebuffer that best represents the group. Typically, this is the framebuffer after the last call in the group finishes.

The pane also shows the image width and height as well as the*x* and*y*coordinates, normalized image coordinates (U and V values), and RBGA hex value for that point on the image.
