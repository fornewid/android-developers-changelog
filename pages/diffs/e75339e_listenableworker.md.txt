 In certain situations, you may need to provide a custom threading strategy. For
 example, you may need to handle a callback-based asynchronous operation.
 WorkManager supports this use case with
-[`ListenableWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker).

 `ListenableWorker` is the most basic worker API;

 `ListenableWorker` only signals when the work should start and stop and leaves
 the threading entirely up to you. The start work signal is invoked on the main
 thread, so it is very important that you go to a background thread of your
 choice manually.

 A `ListenableWorker`'s `ListenableFuture` is always cancelled when the work is
 expected to stop. Using a `CallbackToFutureAdapter`, you simply have to add a
 cancellation listener, as follows:
