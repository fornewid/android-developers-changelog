-To integrate user configurable settings into your app, use the AndroidX Preference library. This library manages the user interface and interacts with storage so that you define only the individual settings that the user can configure. The library comes with a Material Design theme that provides a consistent user experience across devices and OS versions.

 ## Get started
 
-A[`Preference`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/preference)is the basic building block of the Preference library. A settings screen contains a`Preference`*hierarchy* . You can define this hierarchy as an XML resource, or you can[build a hierarchy in code](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings/programmatic-hierarchy).
