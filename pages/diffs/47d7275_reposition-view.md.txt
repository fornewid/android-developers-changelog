-Objects on screen often need to be repositioned due to user interaction or processing behind the scenes. Instead of immediately updating the object's position, which causes it to blink from one area to another, use an animation to move it from the starting position to its end position.
-
-One way that Android lets you reposition your view objects on screen is by using[`ObjectAnimator`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/animations/reposition-view#UseObjectAnimator). You provide the end position you want the object to settle in as well as the duration of the animation. You can also use time interpolators to control the acceleration or deceleration of the animation.

 ## Change the view position with ObjectAnimator
 
-The[`ObjectAnimator`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/animation/ObjectAnimator)API provides a way to change the properties of a view with a specified duration. It contains static methods to create instances of`ObjectAnimator`depending on what type of attribute you are animating. When repositioning your views on screen, use the`translationX`and`translationY`attributes.

 ## Add curved motion
 
-While using the`ObjectAnimator`is convenient, by default it repositions the view along a straight line between the starting and ending points. Material design relies on curves for spatial movement of objects on the screen and the timing of an animation. Using curved motion gives your app a more material feel while making your animations more interesting.

 ### Define your own path
 
-The`ObjectAnimator`class has constructors that let you animate coordinates using two or more properties at once along with a path. For example, the following animator uses a[`Path`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path)object to animate the X and Y properties of a view:
