-# Gradle dependency resolution
-
 Your build files specify your *direct* dependencies, but each of those
 dependencies can require others. These *transitive* dependencies quickly grow
 your overall dependency graph, often with conflicting versions.
-| **Note:** This page uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) throughout and follows a `major.minor.patch` format. For example, in the version number 4.8.3, 4 is the `major` version, 8 is the `minor` version and 3 is the `patch` number. When the `major` part changes, the library might have breaking changes in API or behavior. This can impact your build or application behavior, so you should test your build and app thoroughly to ensure compatibility.

 When the `minor` (new features) or `patch` (bug fixes) parts change, the library
 is still likely to be compatible and less likely to impact your application.
