 ## State preservation
 
 In view-based apps, UI state is managed using a combination of the following:
 
-- [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel)objects
+- [`ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) objects
 - Saved instance state using:
-  - Activity[`onSaveInstanceState()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle))
-  - ViewModel[SavedStateHandle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel/viewmodel-savedstate)

+  - ViewModel [SavedStateHandle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel/viewmodel-savedstate)
   - Local storage to persist the UI state during app and activity transitions

 ## Persistent storage
 
-To enable features such as document saving, loading, and potential real-time collaboration, store strokes and associated data in a serialized format. For the Ink API, manual serialization and deserialization are necessary.
