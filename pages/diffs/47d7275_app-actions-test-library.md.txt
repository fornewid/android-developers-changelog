App Actions Test Library provides a mechanism to test your app's ability to fulfill given Google Assistant intent and parameters, by converting them into an Android deep link or Android intent, that can be asserted and used to instantiate an Android activity.

-Testing is performed in the form of Robolectric unit or instrumented tests in the Android environment. This allows developers to comprehensively test their application by emulating the actual app behavior. For testing BIIs, custom intents, or deep link fulfillment, any instrumented testing framework can be used (UI Automator, Espresso, JUnit4, Appium, Detox, Calabash).

 ## How it works
 
-To integrate App Actions Test Library within the app's testing environment, developers should create new or update existing Robolectric or instrumented tests on the`app`module of the app.

 Test code contains the following parts:
 
 - Initialization of the library instance, in the common setup method or in individual test cases.
-- Each individual test calls the`fulfill`method of the library instance to produce the intent creation result.
+- Each individual test calls the `fulfill` method of the library instance to produce the intent creation result.
 - The developer then asserts the deep link or triggers the App fulfillment, and runs custom validation on the app state.
 
 ## Setup requirements
 
-In order to use the test library, there is some initial app configuration required prior to adding the tests to your application.

 ### Configuration
 
 To use the App Actions Test Library, make sure your app is configured as follows:
 
-- Install the[Android Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api)(AGP)
-- Include a`shortcuts.xml`file in the`res/xml`folder in the`app`module.
-- Make sure`AndroidManifest.xml`includes`<meta-data
-  android:name="android.app.shortcuts" android:resource="@xml/shortcuts" />`under either:
-  - the`<application>`tag
-  - the launcher`<activity>`tag
-- Place the`<capability>`element inside the`<shortcuts>`element in`shortcuts.xml`

 #### Perform assertions
 
 The recommended way to assert App Actions Test Library is:
 
-1. Assert the fulfillment type of the`AppActionsFulfillmentResult`. It has to be`FulfillmentType.INTENT`, or`FulfillmentType.UNFULFILLED`in order to test how the app behaves in case of unexpected BII requests.
-2. There are 2 flavors of fulfillment:`INTENT`and`DEEPLINK`fulfillments.
-   - Normally, the developer can differentiate between`INTENT`and`DEEPLINK`fulfillments by looking at the intent tag in`shortcuts.xml`that they are fulfilling by triggering the library.
-   - If there is an url-template tag under the intent tag, this indicates that the`DEEPLINK`fulfills this intent.
-   - If the result intent's`getData()`method returns a non-null object, this also indicates`DEEPLINK`fulfillment. Likewise, if`getData`returns`null`it means that it is an`INTENT`fulfillment.
-3. For`INTENT`case, typecast`AppActionsFulfillmentResult`to`AppActionsIntentFulfillmentResult`, fetch the Android Intent by calling`getIntent`method and do one of the following:

-4. For`DEEPLINK`case, typecast`AppActionsFulfillmentResult`to`AppActionsIntentFulfillmentResult`(same as for the`INTENT`scenario above), fetch the Android Intent by calling`getIntent`method and assert the deeplink url (accessed through`intent.getData.getHost`).
-5. For both`INTENT`and`DEEPLINK`, you can use the resulting intent to launch the activity with the chosen Android testing framework.

 ## Troubleshoot
 
-If your integration test fails unexpectedly, you can look for AATL log messages in the Android Studio logcat window to get the warning or error level message. You can also[increase the logging level](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/logcat#configure-log-view)to capture more output from the library.
