This method takes a reference to a[`BillingFlowParams`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingFlowParams)object that contains the relevant[`ProductDetails`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/ProductDetails)object obtained from calling[`queryProductDetailsAsync`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient#queryproductdetailsasync)). To create a`BillingFlowParams`object, use the[`BillingFlowParams.Builder`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingFlowParams.Builder)class.

+section to recap all the steps.
 
 ### Verify the purchase
 
-Your app should always verify the legitimacy of purchases before granting benefits to a user. This can be done by following the guidelines described in[Verify purchases before granting entitlements](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/security#verify). Only after verifying the purchase should your app continue to process the purchase and grant entitlements to the user, which is discussed in the next section.

+to the user, which is discussed in the next section.
 
 ### Grant entitlement to the user
 
-Once your app has verified a purchase it can continue to grant the entitlement to the user and notify the user. Before granting entitlement, verify that your app is checking that the[purchase state](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getpurchasestate)is[`PURCHASED`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase.PurchaseState). If the purchase is in PENDING state, your app should notify the user that they still need to complete actions to complete the purchase before entitlement is granted. Only grant entitlement when the purchase transitions from PENDING to SUCCESS. Additional information can be found in[Handling pending transactions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#pending).
-
-If you have attached user identifiers to the purchase as discussed in[attaching user identifiers](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#user-identifiers)you can[retrieve](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getAccountIdentifiers())and use them to attribute to the correct user in your system. This technique is useful when reconciling purchases where your app may have lost context about which user a purchase is for. Note, purchases made outside your app won't have these identifiers set. In this case your app can either grant the entitlement to the logged in user, or prompt the user to select a preferred account.
-
-For[pre-orders](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/one-time-product-multi-purchase-options-offers#pre-order), the purchase is in PENDING state before the release time is reached.

 ### Notify the User
 
-After granting entitlement to the user, your app should show a notification to acknowledge the successful purchase. Because of the notification, the user is not confused as to whether the purchase completed successfully, which could result in the user stopping using your app, contacting user support, or complaining about it on social media. Be aware that your app may detect purchase updates at any time during your application lifecycle. For example, a parent approves a pending purchase on another device, in which case your app may want to delay notifying the user to an appropriate time. Some examples where a delay would be appropriate are:

 - During the action part of a game or cutscenes, showing a message may distract the user. In this case, you must notify the user after the action part is over.
 - During the initial tutorial and user setup parts of the game. For example, a user may have made a purchase outside your app before installing it. We recommend you notify new users of the reward immediately after they open the game or during initial user setup. If your app requires the user to create an account or logging in before granting entitlement to the user it is recommended to communicate to your user which steps to complete to claim their purchase. This is critical since purchases are refunded after 3 days if your app has not processed the purchase.

Additionally, if the purchase was a result of a benefit of a program such as Play Pass your app communicates this to the user. For example "Items received! You just got 100 Gems with Play Pass.

 ### Notify Google the purchase was processed
 
-After your app has granted entitlement to the user and notified them about the successful transaction, your app needs to notify Google that the purchase was successfully processed. This is done by acknowledging the purchase and must be done**within three days so that the purchase isn't automatically refunded and entitlement revoked**. The process for acknowledging different types of purchases is described in the following sections.

 #### Consumable products
 
-For consumables, if your app has a secure backend, we recommend that you use[`Purchases.products:consume`](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.products/consume)to reliably consume purchases. Make sure the purchase wasn't already consumed by checking the`consumptionState`from the result of calling[`Purchases.products:get`](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.products/get). If your app is client-only without a backend, use[`consumeAsync()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient#consumeasync)from the Google Play Billing Library. Both methods fulfill the acknowledgement requirement and indicate that your app has granted entitlement to the user. These methods also enable your app to make the one-time product corresponding to the input purchase token available for repurchase. With`consumeAsync()`you must also pass an object that implements the[`ConsumeResponseListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/ConsumeResponseListener)interface. This object handles the result of the consumption operation. You can override the[`onConsumeResponse()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/ConsumeResponseListener#onConsumeResponse(com.android.billingclient.api.BillingResult,java.lang.String))method, which the Google Play Billing Library calls when the operation is complete.

 ## Handle pending transactions
 
-Google Play supports*pending transactions*, or transactions that require one or more additional steps between when a user initiates a purchase and when the payment method for the purchase is processed. Your app shouldn't grant entitlement to these types of purchases until Google notifies you that the user's payment method was successfully charged.
+Google Play supports *pending transactions*, or transactions that require one or
+more additional steps between when a user initiates a purchase and when the
+payment method for the purchase is processed. Your app shouldn't grant
+entitlement to these types of purchases until Google notifies you that the
+user's payment method was successfully charged.
+
+For example, a user can initiate a transaction by choosing a physical store
+where they'll pay later with cash. The user receives a code through both
+notification and email. When the user arrives at the physical store, they can
+redeem the code with the cashier and pay with cash. Google then notifies both
+you and the user that payment has been received. Your app can then grant
+entitlement to the user.
+
+Call [`enablePendingPurchases()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.Builder#enablependingpurchases(com.android.billingclient.api.PendingPurchasesParams)) as part of initializing the
+`BillingClient` to enable pending transactions for your app. Your app must
+enable and support pending transactions for one-time products. Before adding
+support, be sure you understand the [purchase lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/lifecycle) for pending
+transactions.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> **Note:** For apps using Google Play Billing Library version 7.0 and higher, you can enable pending transactions for subscription prepaid plan purchases. See [Handle
+> subscription pending transactions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/subscriptions#pending) for how to support in your app.
+
+When your app receives a new purchase, either through your
+[`PurchasesUpdatedListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/PurchasesUpdatedListener) or as a result of calling
+[`queryPurchasesAsync`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient#queryPurchasesAsync(com.android.billingclient.api.QueryPurchasesParams,%20com.android.billingclient.api.PurchasesResponseListener)), use the [`getPurchaseState()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/Purchase#getpurchasestate) method to
+determine whether the purchase state is `PURCHASED` or `PENDING`. You should
+grant entitlement **only** when the state is `PURCHASED`.
+
+If your app is running and you have an active Play Billing Library connection
+when the user completes the purchase, your [`PurchasesUpdatedListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/PurchasesUpdatedListener) is
+called again, and the `PurchaseState` is now `PURCHASED`. At this point, your
+app can process the purchase using the standard method for [Detecting and
+Processing Purchases](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#process). Your app should also call `queryPurchasesAsync()` in
+your app's `onResume()` method to handle purchases that have transitioned to the
+`PURCHASED` state while your app was not running.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> **Note:** You should acknowledge a purchase only when the state is `PURCHASED`. That is, don't acknowledge it while a purchase is in `PENDING` state. The three-day acknowledgement window begins only when the purchase state transitions from 'PENDING' to 'PURCHASED'.
+
+When the purchase transitions from `PENDING` to `PURCHASED`, your
+[real_time_developer_notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#configure-rtdn) client receives a
+`ONE_TIME_PRODUCT_PURCHASED` or `SUBSCRIPTION_PURCHASED` notification. If the
+purchase is cancelled, you will receive a `ONE_TIME_PRODUCT_CANCELED` or
+`SUBSCRIPTION_PENDING_PURCHASE_CANCELED` notification. This can happen if your
+customer does not complete payment in the required timeframe. Note that you can
+always use the Google Play Developer API to check the current state of a
+purchase.
+
+> [!NOTE]
+> **Note:** Pending transactions can be tested with application licensing. In addition to two test credit cards, license testers have access to two test instruments for delayed forms of payment where the payment automatically completes or cancels after a couple of minutes. You can find detailed steps on how to test this scenario at [Test pending transactions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/test#pending-purchases).
