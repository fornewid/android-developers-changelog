+## R8 optimization overview
+
+R8 uses a multi-phase process to optimize your app for size and speed. Key
+operations include the following:
+
+- **Code shrinking (also known as tree shaking)** : R8 identifies and removes
+  unreachable code from your application and its library dependencies. By
+  analyzing the entry points of your app (such as `Activities` or `Services`
+  defined in the manifest), R8 builds a graph of referenced code and removes
+  anything that remains unreferenced.
+
+- **Logical optimizations**: R8 rewrites your code to improve execution
+  efficiency and reduce overhead. Key techniques include:
+
+  - **Method inlining**: R8 replaces a method call site with the actual body
+    of the called method. This eliminates the overhead of a function call and
+    lets R8 conduct further optimizations.
+
+  - **Class merging**: R8 combines sets of classes and interfaces into a
+    single class. This reduces the number of classes in the app, lowering
+    memory pressure and improving startup speed.
+
+- **Obfuscation (also known as minification)** : To reduce the size of the DEX
+  file, R8 shortens the names of classes, fields, and methods (for example,
+  `com.example.MyActivity` could become `a.b.a`).
+
+Since 8.12.0 version of Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), R8 also optimizes resources
+as part of its optimization phases. For more information, see [Optimized
+resource shrinking](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/app-optimization/enable-app-optimization#optimize-resource-shrinking).

 and `isShrinkResources = true` (for resource optimization) in your [release

 > [!CAUTION]
 > **Caution:** Tools that replace or modify R8's output can negatively impact runtime performance. R8 is careful about including and testing many optimizations at the code level, in [DEX layout](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/baselineprofiles/dex-layout-optimizations), and in correctly producing Baseline Profiles - other tools producing or modifying DEX files can break these optimizations, or otherwise regress performance.
