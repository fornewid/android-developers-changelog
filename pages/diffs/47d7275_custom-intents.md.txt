-Every app is different, and not all app functionality matches an available[App Actions built-in intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/app-actions/built-in-intents)(BII). For cases where there isn't a BII for your app functionality, you can instead use a custom intent to extend your app with App Actions.

-Like BIIs, custom intents follow the[`shortcuts.xml`](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-actions/action-schema)schema and act as connection points between Assistant and your defined fulfillments. Custom intents also have intent parameters, which you can map to parameters in your corresponding fulfillment.

 ## Limitations
 
 Custom intents have the following limitations:
 
-- The name of a custom intent can't begin with`actions.intent`.
+- The name of a custom intent can't begin with `actions.intent`.
 - The name of a custom intent must be unique among the custom intent names for your app.
-- Only certain data types are available for parameter extraction by Google Assistant (see[Supported types](https://developer.android.com/develop/devices/assistant/custom-intents#supported-types)).
-- Custom intents must contain examples of usable query patterns (see[Query patterns](https://developer.android.com/develop/devices/assistant/custom-intents#query-patterns)).

 - Each query supports a maximum of two text parameters. This limit does not apply to other data types.
 - Custom intents support only the en-US locale. Also, the device and Assistant language settings must match.

 ## Query patterns
 
-Each custom intent you use requires a set of queries expected from the user for that intent. This approach is unlike BIIs, where queries are already modeled for common ways that users express tasks they're trying to do or information they seek.
+Each custom intent you use requires a set of queries expected from the user for

+modeled for common ways that users express tasks they're trying to do or
+information they seek.
+
+In an Android resource file (usually `/res/values/strings.xml`), specify query
+patterns as items in a [string array](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource). When your
+App Action is invoked, Google Assistant checks the user query against your
+query patterns as part of matching the user's intent for fulfillment. Each query
+pattern you provide represents a phrase that you consider valid for the
+corresponding custom intent.

 - *"Hey Google, open Example Game App and start making an apple pie."*
 - *"Hey Google, start Example Game App and craft 5 cake items."*
 - *"Hey Google, use Example Game App to produce cake 5 times."*
 
-To match user queries, provide query patterns that contain the portion of the query after the invocation phrase. For information you want to extract from the query (like text or a number provided by the user), you assign values to the corresponding intent parameter with placeholders in the query pattern.

-To reference a parameter in a query pattern, add`$`to the name of the parameter in your pattern. For example, to create a placeholder value for a parameter such as`<parameter name="date1" ...`(in`actions.xml`) or`<parameter android:name="date1" ...`(in`shortcuts.xml`), you use`$date1`.
