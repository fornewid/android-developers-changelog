-- History. You can find the size of a gesture's history by calling the `MotionEvent` method [`getHistorySize()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent#getHistorySize()). You can then obtain the positions, sizes, time, and pressures of each of the historical events by using the motion event's `getHistorical`*<Value>* methods. History is useful when rendering a trail of the user's finger, such as for touch drawing. See the `MotionEvent` reference for details.
