-# Observe intermediate worker progress
-
-WorkManager has built-in support for setting and observing intermediate progress for workers. If the worker was running while the app was in the foreground, this information can also be shown to the user using APIs which return the[`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveData)of[`WorkInfo`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkInfo).
-
-[`ListenableWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker)now supports the[`setProgressAsync()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker#setProgressAsync(androidx.work.Data))API, which allows it to persist intermediate progress. These APIs allow developers to set intermediate progress that can be observed by the UI. Progress is represented by the[`Data`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Data)type, which is a serializable container of properties (similar to[`input`and`output`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced#params), and subject to the same restrictions).
-
-Progress information can only be observed and updated while the`ListenableWorker`is running. Attempts to set progress on a`ListenableWorker`after it has completed its execution are ignored.
-
-You can also observe progress information by using the one of the[`getWorkInfoBy...()`or`getWorkInfoBy...LiveData()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkManager#getWorkInfoById(java.util.UUID))methods. These methods return instances of[`WorkInfo`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkInfo), which has a new[`getProgress()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkInfo#getProgress())method that returns`Data`.

 ## Update progress
 
-For Java developers using a[`ListenableWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker)or a[`Worker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker), the[`setProgressAsync()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker#setProgressAsync(androidx.work.Data))API returns a`ListenableFuture<Void>`; updating progress is asynchronous, given that the update process involves storing progress information in a database. In Kotlin, you can use the[`CoroutineWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/CoroutineWorker)object's[`setProgress()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/CoroutineWorker#setprogress)extension function to update progress information.
