-# Threading in Worker
-
-When you use a[`Worker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker), WorkManager automatically calls[`Worker.doWork()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker#doWork())on a background thread. The background thread comes from the`Executor`specified in WorkManager's[`Configuration`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Configuration). By default, WorkManager sets up an`Executor`for you---but you can also customize your own. For example, you can share an existing background Executor in your app, create a single-threaded`Executor`to make sure all your background work executes sequentially, or even specify a custom`Executor`. To customize the`Executor`, make sure you initialize WorkManager manually.

-Note that[`Worker.doWork()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker#doWork())is a synchronous call---you are expected to do the entirety of your background work in a blocking fashion and finish it by the time the method exits. If you call an asynchronous API in`doWork()`and return a[`Result`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker.Result), your callback may not operate properly.
