 ## Overview
 
-This extension allows applications to create an`UNBOUNDED_ANDROID`reference space. This reference space enables the viewer to move freely through a complex environment, often many meters from where they started, while always optimizing for coordinate system stability near the viewer. As the device senses more of its environment to build a better scene understanding, the origin of the reference space**can** drift with**huge adjustments**as necessary to maintain device tracking.

-When views, controllers or other spaces experience tracking loss relative to the`UNBOUNDED_ANDROID`space, applications**can** continue to receive inferred or last-known`position`and`orientation`values. These inferred poses**can** , for example, be based on neck model updates, inertial dead reckoning, or a last-known position. An application can assume that it will continue to have the`XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_VALID_BIT`and`XR_VIEW_STATE_POSITION_VALID_BIT`set, but`XR_SPACE_LOCATION_POSITION_TRACKED_BIT`and`XR_VIEW_STATE_POSITION_TRACKED_BIT`may be cleared by the runtime to indicate that the position is inferred or last-known in this way.

-When tracking is recovered, the runtime**may** recenter the origin arbitrarily, for example moving the origin to coincide with the viewer.
