 ## Device roles
 
-A device participating in a ranging session must be either an*initiator* or a*responder* . The initiator device starts the ranging session with one or more responder devices. A responder device responds to ranging requests from only one initiator at a time. You can specify the role for a given device in a ranging session with the[`RangingPreference`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/ranging/RangingPreference)class.

 ## Ranging session types
 
-When starting a ranging session between devices, it's often necessary to establish an out-of-band (OOB) data transport to exchange parameters for the session.

 ### Default OOB implementation
 
-In this session type ([`RANGING_SESSION_OOB`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/ranging/RangingConfig#RANGING_SESSION_OOB)), the Ranging module handles OOB negotiations to start a ranging session. It selects suitable parameters based on the ranging preferences provided by the app, and it uses the appropriate technologies based on what both devices support. This session type uses a standardized[`OOB specification`](https://source.android.com/partners/android-16/core/connect/ranging-oob-spec).

 ### Custom OOB implementation
 
-In this session type ([`RANGING_SESSION_RAW`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/ranging/RangingConfig#RANGING_SESSION_RAW)), the app bypasses the Ranging module's OOB flow and handles its own OOB negotiation and parameters. That means the app much determine which technologies the peer device supports, negotiate ranging parameters, and begin the ranging session.

 ## Ranging permission
 
-The Ranging module requires a new unified permission (`android.permission.RANGING`) to access all current and future ranging technologies. This permission is in the`NEARBY_DEVICES_PERMISSIONS`list.

+- Third-party apps are only allowed to perform background ranging with ultra-wideband, and only on [supported devices](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/uwb#uwb-enabled_mobile_devices). Ranging in the background with other technologies is not allowed.
 - Ranging is not allowed when the maximum number of concurrent ranging sessions by device has been reached.
 - Ranging might be restricted due to system health concerns such as battery, performance, or memory.
 
 The Ranging module also has the following known limitations:
 
 - The Ranging module only supports delivery of ranging data to peer devices for ultra-wideband. For other technologies, the Ranging module only delivers ranging data to the initiator device.
-- The Ranging module only supports dynamic addition of devices in[raw ranging mode](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/ranging#custom), and only for ultra-wideband.
-- The Ranging module doesn't support one-to-many ultra-wideband sessions for[default OOB implementations](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/ranging#default). If you pass in multiple device handles, the module creates a one-to-one session for each peer device that supports ultra-wideband.

 ## Conduct a ranging session
 
 To conduct a ranging session using the Ranging module, follow these steps:
 
 1. Verify that all devices are operating on Android 16 or higher.

 4. Discover a peer device for ranging operations.
-5. Establish a connection for an out-of-band exchange, using either of the session types described in[Ranging session types](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/ranging#session-types).
