 - **Wearable-specific visual behavior**: Jetpack Compose Glimmer offers its own specific focus indicators and visual feedback that are better suited for AI glasses, differing from typical Android behaviors like ripples and overscroll effects.
 - **Built on Jetpack Compose, allowing for pre-compatible input**: The Jetpack Compose Glimmer library leverages lower-level Compose features to support user input methods like tap and swipe by default.
 - **Pre-built components and extensibility**: Jetpack Compose Glimmer offers prebuilt composables and components like cards and lists for common use cases, while also being extensible for more custom needs.
