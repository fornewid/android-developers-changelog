-# Audio Manager self-managed call guide
-
 This guide covers communication applications, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), that want to self-manage their audio and hearable device state.
-| **Note:** Starting in Android 13 (API level 33), applications must migrate from[`AudioManager#startBluetoothSco()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#startBluetoothSco())to[`AudioManager#setCommunicationDevice()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager#setCommunicationDevice(android.media.AudioDeviceInfo))to support upcoming BLE audio headsets. This change is backward-compatible with Hands-Free Profile (HFP) devices.

 Now that the BLE Audio device has been set, when placing a call, the audio stream will have the correct audio routing.
