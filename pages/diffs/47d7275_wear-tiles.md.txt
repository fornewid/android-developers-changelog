   - This significantly improves Tiles loading time by removing the need for two binder calls as only the `onTileResourcesRequest` method can be implemented.
   - When using image resources directly in the layout, there is no longer a need to manually override `onTileResourcesRequest` or specify resources in `TilePreviewData`.
 - **Material3TileService:** Introduced a new, Kotlin-friendly service for creating tiles. It simplifies development by providing a single `suspend` function to return both tile layout and resources. It automatically manages the `MaterialScope` and `ProtoLayoutScope` for better resource handling and performance improvements on faster Tiles loading.
-  - Simplified code snippet: `class MyTileService : Material3TileService() {
-    override suspend fun **MaterialScope.tileResponse**(
-    requestParams: RequestBuilders.TileRequest
-    ): TileBuilders.Tile = tile(
-    timeline = timeline(timelineEntry(

 - **Tile Previews Update:** Tooling for Tile Previews has been updated to support the new `ProtoLayoutScope` automatic resource handling, ensuring previews reflect inlined resources correctly without extra configuration.
+
 - **Many Kotlin DSL Improvements:** Added specialized Kotlin helpers for `Tile` and all other APIs needed to build a tile (such as `Timeline`) to improve the developer experience for Kotlin users.
+
 - **Dynamic Service Switching:** Introduced `METADATA_GROUP_KEY`, allowing developers to group multiple `TileService` instances in the manifest. This enables dynamic switching between different services that represent the same tile on new OS versions.
+
 - **Tile ID in Updates:** Developers can now specify a particular `tileId` in update requests, allowing for more granular control over which tile instances are refreshed.
