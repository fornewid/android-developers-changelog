-# Analyze vibration waveforms
+The most common vibration actuators on Android devices are [linear resonant
+actuators (LRAs)](https://medium.com/@SomaticLabs/what-is-a-linear-resonant-actuator-81cc25f85779). LRAs simulate the feeling of a button click
+on what is otherwise an unresponsive glass surface. A clear and crisp click
+feedback signal typically lasts between 10 and 20 milliseconds in duration. This
+sensation makes user interactions feel more natural. For virtual keyboards, this
+click feedback can increase typing speed and reduce errors.

+LRAs have a few common [resonant frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance#Examples):
 
 - Some LRAs had resonant frequencies in the 200 to 300 Hz range, which coincides with the frequency at which human skin is most sensitive to vibration. The sensation of vibrations at this frequency range are usually described as smooth, sharp, and penetrating.
-- Other models of LRAs have lower resonance frequencies, at around 150 Hz. The sensation is qualitatively softer and fuller (in dimension).

-Given the same input voltage at two different frequencies, the vibration output amplitudes can be different. The further away the frequency is from the LRA's resonant frequency, the lower its vibration amplitude.

-A given device's haptic effects use both the vibration actuator and its driver. Haptic drivers that include overdrive and active braking features can reduce the rise time and ringing of LRAs, leading to a more responsive and clear vibration.

 ## Vibrator output acceleration
 
-<br />
 
-The frequency-to-output-acceleration mapping (FOAM) describes the maximum achievable output acceleration (in G peak) at a given vibration frequency (in Hertz). Starting in Android 16 (API level 36), the platform provides built-in support for this mapping through the`VibratorFrequencyProfile`. You can use this class, along with the[basic](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibrationEffect.BasicEnvelopeBuilder)and[advanced](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibrationEffect.WaveformEnvelopeBuilder)envelope APIs, to create haptic effects.

-Most LRA motors have a single peak in their FOAM, typically near their resonant frequency. Acceleration generally decreases exponentially as frequency deviates from this range. The curve may not be symmetrical and might feature a plateau around the resonant frequency to protect the motor from damage.

 ### Human perception detection threshold

-The*human perception detection threshold*refers to the minimum acceleration of a vibration that a person can reliably detect. This level varies based on the vibration frequency.

-Android automatically handles this threshold in the`BasicEnvelopeBuilder`, which verifies that all effects use a frequency range that prodcues vibration amplitudes that exceed the human perception detection threshold by at least 10 dB.

-Android automatically handles this conversion in the`BasicEnvelopeBuilder`, which takes values as normalized intensities in the sensation level space (dB SL) and converts them to output acceleration. The`WaveformEnvelopeBuilder`, on the other hand, doesn't apply this conversion and takes values as normalized output acceleration amplitudes in the acceleration space (Gs) instead. The envelope API assumes that, when a designer or developer thinks about changes in vibration strength, they expect the perceived intensity to follow a piecewise linear envelope.
