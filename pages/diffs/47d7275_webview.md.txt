When the HTML in the `WebView` is untrustworthy---for example, part or all of the HTML is provided by an unknown person or process---then an attacker can include HTML that executes your client-side code and possibly any code of the attacker's choosing. Therefore, don't use `addJavascriptInterface()` unless you wrote all of the HTML and JavaScript that appears in your `WebView`. Don't let the user navigate within your `WebView` to web pages that aren't your own. Instead, let the user's default browser application open foreign links.
