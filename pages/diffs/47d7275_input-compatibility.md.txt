 Keyboard navigation is rarely implemented in touch-centric apps, but users expect it when they are using an app with a keyboard. It can also be essential for users with accessibility needs on both phones and desktop devices.
 
 
-For many apps, arrow key and tab navigation is all that is needed and is mostly handled automatically by the Android framework. For example, a view of a `Button` is focusable by default, and keyboard navigation should generally work without any additional code. In order to enable keyboard navigation for views that are not focusable by default, developers should mark them as focusable. This can be done programmatically or in XML, as follows.

 Shortcuts can be implemented using [`dispatchKeyShortcutEvent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window.Callback#dispatchKeyShortcutEvent(android.view.KeyEvent)). This intercepts all meta-key combinations (`alt`, `ctrl`, and `shift`) for a given keycode. To check for a specific meta-key, use [`KeyEvent.isCtrlPressed()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#isCtrlPressed()), [`KeyEvent.isShiftPressed()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#isShiftPressed()), [`KeyEvent.isAltPressed()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#isAltPressed()), or [`KeyEvent.hasModifiers()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#hasModifiers(int)).

Allowing all meta-key combinations can also be more convenient for users who are accustomed to different keyboard layouts and operating systems.
